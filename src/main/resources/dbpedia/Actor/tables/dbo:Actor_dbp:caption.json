  "text" : "Richard Bird (1894 – 28 September 1986) was an English actor and director of stage and screen. Born George, Bird took the stage name Richard Bird after being nicknamed \"Dickie\" by his theatre colleagues. After working in a newspaper office for a year he made his stage debut as a member of the Liverpool Repertory Company in 1917. He went on to appear on both the London and American stage, making his film debut in some silent shorts during 1919. He appeared in films throughout the 1930s and 1940s, mostly in comedic roles. His most memorable film performances were as Richard French in the supernatural Ealing drama The Halfway House and as Arthur the ghost in the comedy Don't Take It to Heart (both 1944). He made his last film in 1949 but carried on acting in television until the 1960s. He directed the 1938 film version of Edgar Wallace's The Terror, as well as the 1943 stage adaptation of Graham Greene's Brighton Rock at the Garrick Theatre, London. He died in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada."

  "text" : "Richard Cowley (died 1619) was an actor in English Renaissance theatre, a colleague of William Shakespeare and Richard Burbage in the Lord Chamberlain's Men and the King's Men. Cowley was in the c. 1591 production of The Seven Deadly Sins, performed by personnel from the Admiral's Men and Lord Strange's Men — a production that included Richard Burbage and other future King's Men. Cowley acted seven minor roles in that production. He also toured with some of the same personnel under Edward Alleyn in 1593. He is thought to have been an original shareholder in the Lord Chamberlain's Men when they re-formed in 1594; but little is known about his career, except for the fact that he played Verges in Much Ado About Nothing, along with William Kempe as Dogberry. For some reason he is not in the cast lists on the three Ben Jonson plays acted by the company in 1598–1603; but he is still one of the sharers when the company is chartered as the King's Men in 1603, and he receives a bequest in the 1605 will of Augustine Phillips. He is known to have married and had four children; two died young. His wife Elizabeth was buried on 28 September 1616 and his own burial followed on 12 March 1619. His will was witnessed by Cuthbert Burbage, John Heminges, Thomas Ravenscroft, and John Shank."

  "text" : "Simon Lack (19 December 1913 – 8 August 1980) was a Scottish actor, working mostly in England. He was born Alexander MacAlpine, in Cleland, Lanarkshire, Scotland. Known locally as Alec, he was the youngest child and only son of his father, Alexander McAlpine (known as Sandy) and his mother Euphemia Ritchie. His sisters were Charlotte (Lottie), Mary, Euphemia (Euphie), Agnes (Nan) and Jenny. Another sister, Jessie, died in childhood. Sandy McAlpine was a stonemason, but worked down the mines when there was no masonry work available, making Simon Lack's later role in Proud Valley particularly poignant to those who knew him from his youth. Euphemia Ritchie's family were somewhat wealthier, but she was disowned on account of her choice of husband, and the family lived for many years in a one-room flat (known in Scottish working class language as a 'single end'), although it seems eventually one of her uncles relented and came to their aid. Alec's earliest ventures into acting were in local theatres. He seems to have chosen the pseudonym Simon Lack when he embarked upon the London stage. He lost five years during the Second World War (as did so many British actors). He served in the European theatre, and was present at Monte Cassino. After the war he returned to acting, getting back into stage work. He was also a member of the BBC Radio company during the late 1950s/early 1960s, and notably guest-starred in all but two of the Paul Temple serials (mysteries) that starred Peter Coke and Marjorie Westbury. His television roles included two Doctor Who serials; The Mind of Evil (1971) and The Androids of Tara (1978). He also guest-starred in episodes of The Saint, Jason King, and Doomwatch. He had co-starring roles in Telford's Change, Enemy at the Door and The Borgias."

In 2004, he starred in a self-penned one man show called Jackson's Way at the Edinburgh Fringe. The intended run for the production was ten days, before the intervention of comedian Stewart Lee. Lee was so impressed by Adamsdale's work that he reportedly threw his full support behind Jackson's Way, lobbying for an extension of the run and using his clout within the industry to garner notice from critics and award committees. Adamsdale secured the Perrier Comedy Award for comedy. Adamsdale has since created several new shows: The Receipt, The Human Computer, and The Summer House. The Receipt, a collaboration with sonic artist Chris Branch, used innovative sound effects to punctuate a story about the little man in the big city. It ran at the Edinburgh Fringe 2006, winning a Fringe First and a Total Theatre Award. It subsequently toured nationally, and internationally to the Melbourne Comedy Festival and 59E59 Theatres in New York. In The Human Computer, Adamsdale, a self-confessed technophobe, explored the world of computers. The show premiered in the new Traverse 3 venue at the Edinburgh Fringe 2007. He made his film acting debut in The Boat That Rocked as Newsreader John, in 2009. He is now a regular cast member of the Channel 4 2011 series Campus, playing Jason the University accountant."

She later worked for the BBC as a radio interviewer, before appearing in London's West End. In the 1970s she was a member of director Frank Dunlop's repertory company in London's Young Vic Theatre, appearing in several productions and beginning her career as a playwright with some children's shows. Coffey has had a few supporting film roles. These have included Sidonia in Waltz of the Toreadors (1962), Peg in Georgy Girl (1966), Soberness in Far from the Madding Crowd (1967), and Mrs. E in Vivian Stanshall's Sir Henry at Rawlinson End (1980).

She is perhaps best remembered internationally for starring in the 1971 James Bond film Diamonds Are Forever in which she played a seemingly innocent Christian school teacher who smuggled diamonds in her bible for the henchmen Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd. In the film, she was later found murdered and her body recovered out of an Amsterdam canal. She also had cameo role in John Schlesinger's 1961 semi-documentary \"Terminus\" as the elderly lady who lost her umbrella. She was friendly with Schlesinger and appeared in small parts in several of his films. For some years in the 1950s and 1960s she held regular dancing classes at the former Metropole Hotel in Colwyn Bay. Lacey also made appearances in Dr Finlays Casebook (1960s), Z-Cars and her last credited appearance was in Magnum, P.I. in 1985."

  "text" : "John Salew (1902 in Portsmouth, Hampshire – 14 September 1961 in London) was a British stage film and TV actor. Salew made the transition from stage to films in 1939, and according to Allmovie, \"the manpower shortage during WWII enabled the stout, balding Salew to play larger and more important roles than would have been his lot in other circumstances. He usually played suspicious-looking characters, often Germanic in origin.\" His screen roles included William Shakespeare in the comic fantasy Time Flies (1944), Grimstone in the Gothic melodrama Uncle Silas (1947), and the librarian in the supernatural thriller Night of the Demon (1957). John Salew was active into the TV era, playing the sort of character parts that John McGiver played in the U.S."

Previously known for his explosive speed and power, he won numerous national and international competitions in the eighties and early nineties, including the first Asian Games in 1990. He is considered by many as a bridge between traditional Chinese martial arts and modern wushu for his successful integration of traditional and modern techniques at a level of fluidity, technique, and explosiveness that had not been seen before, and which has yet to have been matched today. He is a former Shanxi wushu team athlete trained by the coaches Pang Lin Tai and Zhang Ling Mei. He became the standard that other athletes were judged by in the nineties: his personal long fist and staff forms were famously made into the compulsory wushu guiding forms which other athletes had to perform and compete in."
