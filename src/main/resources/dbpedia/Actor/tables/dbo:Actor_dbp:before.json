  "text" : "Hugh Sinclair (19 May 1903 – 29 December 1962) was a British actor born in London, England, the son of a clergyman. He was educated at Charterhouse School and a graduate of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. His first marriage was to the actress Valerie Taylor. In his book The Stage Struck Me! fellow actor Neville Phillips felt Sinclair always played variations of himself, handsome, debonair, suave and witty and excelled in light comedy. By contrast Phillips felt his wife, who Sinclair often appeared opposite, was a dramatic actress of tremendous power with a magnificent voice. Sinclair appeared both on Broadway and on the West End. His screen work began in British films. His most notable role possibly is Leslie Charteris' The Saint in The Saint's Vacation followed by The Saint Meets the Tiger. Sinclair died in Slapton, England at the age of 59."

  "text" : "Alfred Arthur Hinchcliffe Denville (27 January 1876 – 23 March 1955) was an English actor, theatre impresario and Conservative Party politician. Denville, an actor by trade, ran one of the UK's leading repertory companies. In 1924 Denville founded Denville Hall, a retirement home for actors in Northwood, London that is still in operation. As a politician Denville was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Newcastle upon Tyne Central seat from Sir Charles Trevelyan in the 1931 general election and held the seat until he was defeated in 1945. For a time he was associated with the far right of the Conservative Party, and during the 1930s was a leading member of the Friends of National Spain, which stressed support for Francisco Franco and anti-communism. He had also declared himself to be an admirer of Benito Mussolini although, in keeping with a number of contemporary Tories who admired the southern European fascists, he was critical of Adolf Hitler."
