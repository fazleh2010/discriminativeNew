In his book The Stage Struck Me! fellow actor Neville Phillips felt Sinclair always played variations of himself, handsome, debonair, suave and witty and excelled in light comedy. By contrast Phillips felt his wife, who Sinclair often appeared opposite, was a dramatic actress of tremendous power with a magnificent voice. Sinclair appeared both on Broadway and on the West End. His screen work began in British films. His most notable role possibly is Leslie Charteris' The Saint in The Saint's Vacation followed by The Saint Meets the Tiger.

Her “memorable...and exceptional” performance of Iphigenia in The Greeks and Juliet in Romeo and Juliet were particularly notable. Time magazine critic T.E. Kalem wrote of her “unforgettable” portrayal of Iphigenia: “...as Buxton reaches the heartbreaking conclusion that the one life she has to give for Hellas is the noblest life to have lived, she radiates a great and unforgettable purity of spirit.” She later worked mainly in television, playing Ruth in the television comedy On the Up, Inga, Roj Blake's cousin in Blake's Seven and Susan Protheroe in 1983's production of By The Sword Divided. In 2006 she was in the cast of a well-received UK touring production of Noël Coward’s Star Quality. She appeared in two series-three episodes of Rising Damp, as Caroline Armitage.
