  "text" : "Connie Chiu (born 1969) was the world's first albinistic fashion model. Chiu was born in British Hong Kong to a Chinese family. Like many people with albinism, she has to protect her photosensitive eyes and skin from the sunlight. As a result, her family moved to Sweden when she was seven. Connie Chiu was first introduced to modeling when her sister asked her to become a model at one of her final shows. At age 25, Chiu began modeling for fashion photographers such as Terry Richardson, Paul Burley, Heidi Niemala and Morten Smidt. Chiu later studied journalism. Chiu starred in the music video for the single \"Stalker\" by Recoil, the solo project of Depeche Mode member Alan Wilder."
