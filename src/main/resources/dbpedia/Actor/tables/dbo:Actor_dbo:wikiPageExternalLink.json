  "text" : "Race Wong is an actress, singer and businesswoman. Born in Malaysia, raised in Singapore, she pursued her career in the entertainment industry in Hong Kong with her sister Rosanne Wong which won her various awards for her singing career as the cantopop group 2R, including Most Promising Newcomer and Most Popular Group Award in the Annual Top 10 Song of the Year Awards (2003), Metro Broadcasting Music awards (2004), TVB Top 10 Songs of the Year (2004) and Hong Kong Commercial Radio Music Awards’ (2003). Race Wong became a spotlight when she was chosen to star alongside Stephen Chow in his famous annual San Miguel TV advertisement. Following that, she rose to fame for her leading role in a TVB youth series Hearts Of Fencing. Which jumpstarted both her singing and acting career. Race Wong hoped to focus her acting on roles beyond her youthful and sweet appearance. Her outstanding performance in her first leading role in movie Abnormal Beauty Abnormal Beauty won her a nomination for the Best New Actor in the 24th Annual Hong Kong Film Awards (2005) and the 42nd Golden Horse Film Awards’ (2005) in Taiwan. Race Wong continued to experiment with different roles both on-screen and off-screen. In 2006, together with her sister Rosanne Wong, they took on groundbreaking leading roles in a musical adaption of The Smiling Proud Wanderer stage performance by the Hong Kong Dance Company (2006) where Rosanne famously shaved bald for the role. The musical enjoyed a success which brought them to perform in Shanghai the following year. Later in 2008, Race Wong’s starring role as a pregnant new immigrant from China was a break away from her usual youthful image in the movie True Women For Sale which earned her a nomination for Best Supporting Actress in the 28th Hong Kong Film Awards (2009). Race is one of the very rare few Singaporeans to have been nominated in the Hong Kong Film Awards. In 2010, Race Wong decided to step out of the limelight for a break. She took on a Masters of Business course to further her education and graduated with a Masters of Business majoring in Marketing from the University of Newcastle (Australia) in 2013. Concurrently in 2011, she made an unexpected career change into finance, taking on the role of Marketing Manager at Maybank Kim Eng Securities (Hong Kong). She was licensed with the Securities and Futures Commission to conduct equities trading. The year she turned 30, Race Wong made a surprising move to relocate back to Singapore where her family is based. Together with her younger sister Rhonda Wong, she set up Anthill Realtors Pte. Ltd. in 2013 a real estate agency licensed with CEA. She then co-founded Ohmyhome Pte Ltd in 2015, a tech company focused on connecting buyers to sellers, landlords to tenants in real estate. When asked about her career move, Race said that she wanted to focus her attention on something that will provide more value to people, something on the opposite spectrum of her celebrity lifestyle. She speaks fluent Cantonese, Mandarin, and English."

He is now a choreographer and dancer, and he is a member of the dancing group Oyaji dancers, where oyaji is a faintly derogatory Japanese word literally meaning \"dad\" but also used for middle-aged men in general. He also works as an actor, a lyricist, and a songwriter, as well as arranging and producing music. Suzuki made a brief appearance as a dancer in the video for the song O! O! Xsta Si ( Boom Boom Love ) by the J-pop group Deeps. He was the choreographer for one of AKB48's biggest hits: \"Koisuru Fortune Cookie\" (2013)."

  "text" : "Philip Bowen is a British actor who has appeared in a number of British film and television roles including in Agatha Christie's Poirot, Kavanagh QC and Soldier Soldier. He was born in Sutton Coldfield, Warwickshire, in 1946. Phil’s professional career started at Leatherhead in Puss in Boots playing the back end of the donkey. Seasons in rep followed at Guildford, Derby, Nottingham, Birmingham, Oxford and Newcastle as well as television, radio and some film work in Hollywood. Foreign touring for the British Council, including three years with Sir Michael Redgrave coupled with seasons at Regent’s Park and the Young Vic where he played Hamlet directed by Michael Bogdanov, developed a love for Shakespeare. Associations with Tim Carroll, Master of Verse at Shakespeare’s Globe, included touring Germany and playing Prospero in Maidstone Prison with the inmates playing the other parts. He met his wife, Susannna Best, while they were touring with the English Shakespeare Company and together they set up the charity, Shakespeare Link. Their vision was to access Shakespeare beyond the confines of theatre or academe, as a stimulus for communication and debate. They worked in the community, with therapists, with young people and senior citizens as well as in hospitals and prisons; teaching, directing and performing took them to Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Beirut, the Philippines, Tunisia, Mauritius, Indonesia, Malaysia, the US and Canada.Now settled on the family smallholding in the Upper Wye Valley they have been translating Shakespeare into BSL, working with local schools and groups and running ‘Have-a-go Shakespeare’ sessions with all comers. In 2006 they headed up a team to plant the magical Willow Globe, woven of living willow and open to the sky, which they run both as a producing and a receiving house. Such is the success of the Willow Globe Community Company, under Phil’s guidance, that it has been invited to play CADW heritage sites and, by the RSC, to perform at Stratford. In 1996 Phil founded 'Shakespeare Link' with his wife, Susanna Best (mother of the actress Eve Best), and is focused on broadening the appeal and accessibility of Shakespeare. This work was further extended with the establishment of the Willow Globe theatre on land at their home near Llanwrthwl, Powys in Wales."

The Guardian called her \"An actress of power and passion who mingled sex appeal with forthright emotion.\" She trained at Webber-Douglas, where she won the award for best actress. There followed stage work including Shakespeare, Shaw and Ostrovsky. In the West End she was Maria in Twelfth Night, and the General's daughter in Anouilh's The Fighting Cock at the Duke of York's. At the  Assembly Rooms in York, her performance in Ibsen's Little Eyolf was described by critics as \"genuinely revelatory.\" In 1970 she married David Conville, director of the Open Air Theatre, Regents Park, where she made many of her later stage appearances. Interspersed amongst her stage work were film and TV parts, including starring as the seductive Jane in The Troubleshooters, This Is My Street, Man in a Suitcase, the title role in William Douglas Home's The Reluctant Debutante (ITV Play of the Week), Giants On Saturday, Triangle, Brett, Coronation Street, The Sweeney and the Ruth Rendell thriller A Fatal Inversion. Gail also taught drama at the Eugene O'Neill Centre and South Florida University, and continued to appear on stage before retiring in 1996. She died of cancer in 1999, and was survived by her husband David and their son."

  "text" : "Gary Hailes (born 4 November 1965 in London) is an English actor. Hales attended Holloway School. During the 1980s he starred in several successful television series, including Woodentop, Grange Hill and the BBC soap opera EastEnders, where he played Barry Clark from 1986-89. He originally auditioned for the role of Mark Fowler when the series began in 1985, but the role went to David Scarboro instead. Hailes' character was notable for being one half of the soap's first gay couple, introduced as the partner of the yuppie graphic designer, Colin Russell (played by Michael Cashman). In 1987 Hailes' character caused a great deal of controversy after EastEnders screened the first male-to-male kiss on a UK, prime time soap. The kiss prompted a multitude of complaints from angry viewers and a hostile backlash from the right wing press. Despite the fact that Hailes is heterosexual, he suffered from severe homophobia because of the homosexual role he played in EastEnders. He was attacked several times by members of the public who couldn't separate fact from fiction, which included being assaulted in a supermarket by a disapproving woman and strangled by a man at a petrol station. Even after he left the show he lost a job as a children's television presenter because of the so-called \"gay tag\". Since leaving EastEnders in 1989, he has gone on to appear in films such as The Killing Zone (1999); Murder with Mirrors and Waiting for a Killer. On television he has appeared in ITV police drama The Bill (2001–02); Horizon; Nobody’s Hero; Sorry and the BBC’s production of Pinocchio. Theatre appearances include Strip Poker; Doctor on the Boil; Gollocks and numerous pantomimes. He has also performed several plays for BBC radio and voice-overs and had a regular slot \"Hailes Horrors\" on the Steve Allen show on LBC radio. As well as acting, Hailes also drives a London taxi."

She later appeared in The Bill, Doc Martin, Holby City, Hustle, Casualty, Ideal and Sensitive Skin, among other episodes. She guest starred as Christine in the episode \"From Out of the Rain\" in season 2 of the BBC spin-off show Torchwood. On film, she is best remembered for the role of Mrs. Connelly in Duplex.

  "text" : "(This is a Chinese name; the family name is Leung.) Edmond Leung Hon-man (born 5 November 1971) is a Hong Kong singer-songwriter, record producer, actor, and television host from Hong Kong. At age 17, Leung became a finalist in the eighth annual New Talent Singing Awards (新秀歌唱大賽) in 1989, which won him a contract with Capital Artists. He made his recording debut in 1990 with the release of Listen to the Edge (細聽鋒芒). He propelled to teen idol stardom in the mid-1990s and was famous for his rather feminine look, in which many of his songs portray the life of timid men dumped by their lovers. He was frozen by TVB for three months after he uttered profanity during a live broadcast of the Tung Wah Charity Show in 1995. In 2001, Capital Artists failed in the market, and Leung was left contract-less for over a year. During this time, Leung began composing music and was the leader of William So's concert band, while also learning to play the piano. Under the guidance of Paco Wong, he signed to Gold Typhoon in 2003, being marketed as a singer-songwriter.

  "text" : "Ellen Pollock (29 June 1902 – 29 March 1997) was a British character actress, mainly appeared on stage in London's West End. She also appeared in several films and TV productions. A devotee of Bernard Shaw, she was president of the Shaw Society from 1949. In their obituary, the Independent wrote \"Pollock is believed to have played, in a career spanning 72 years, more Shavian heroines than anyone else. She directed London seasons of his plays; and it was during the London premiere of one of his lesser-known works – Farfetched Fables (Watergate, 1950) – that she announced Shaw's death from the stage.\" Pollock's dedication to acting began as a seven-year-old, when she saw Sarah Bernhardt on stage; she knew then that she wanted to be an actress herself. Pollock was also a theatre director and a teacher of drama at RADA and Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art; and her varied television work included several appearances in The Forsyte Saga for the BBC. She outlived both husbands, Captain Leslie Hancock and the artist James Proudfoot. She had one child with Captain Hancock. Pollock was the subject of TV's This Is Your Life in 1992. Ellen Pollock's mother, Hedwig Kahn, was the sister of Otto Hermann Kahn (wealthy investment banker, collector, philanthropist, and patron of the arts) and composer Robert Kahn."

He has been a fight choreographer for, amongst others, Jackie Chan, King Hu, and John Woo. Hung is one of the pivotal figures who spearheaded the Hong Kong New Wave movement of the 1980s, helped reinvent the martial arts genre and started the vampire-like jiangshi genre. He is widely credited with assisting many of his compatriots, giving them their starts in the Hong Kong film industry, by casting them in the films he produced, or giving them roles in the production crew. It is common for Asians to address their elders or influential people with familial nouns as a sign of familiarity and respect. Jackie Chan, for example, is often addressed as \"Da Goh\" (Chinese: 大哥; pinyin: dà gē), meaning Big Brother. Hung was also known as \"Dai Goh\", until the filming of Project A, which featured both actors. As Hung was the eldest of the kung fu \"brothers\", and the first to make a mark on the industry, he was given the nickname \"Da Goh Da\" (Chinese: 大哥大; pinyin: dà gē dà; Jyutping: daai6 go1 daai6), meaning, Big, Big Brother, or Biggest Big Brother."

  "text" : "Samantha Holland (born 17 September 1969) is an English actress. She trained at The Guildhall School of Music and Drama (1988–91) where her year group included Daniel Craig Her work has covered a wide range in theatre, television, film and radio, but predominantly in theatre. From 2014 - 2015 her work has incorporated radio comedy, short film making and art installation. In 2014 DIS_CONNECT at the New Red Studios posed questions about how real our connection is with one another in a seemingly interconnected world. Have we become more disconnected? It involved red tape, umbrellas, briefcases, data collection, public information broadcasts and a bit of Cat Stevens. In 2013 She performed a new satire about the Pythia of Delphi at the Sir John Soane's Museum in London. She appeared in the BBC Radio comedy programme Hudson & Pepperdine Save the Planet as Marina, the fast talking manic depressive. Notable performances include Frankie in the Chichester Festival Theatre production of the Rodney Ackland play \"After October\" with Dorothy TutinTHEATRE: After October; Chichester Festival Theatre Paul Taylor. Ackland assembles a sizeable group of people whose hopes are hanging on Clive's play being a hit. These range from his sister, Joan (Maria Miles) - who, freed from dependency on her philistine of a lover, will be able to attend art school - to the depressive paying guest Frankie (an excellent Samantha Holland), who will be able to marry Clive and get rid of the well-meaning but boring Brian (Gregory Floy) with his stuffy old colonial slang (\"feeling pretty bobbish, thanks\") and his formulaic generosity. Tessa Bold in David Farr's play Max Klapper - A Life in Pictures at the Electric Cinema Her Edinburgh One Woman Show \"Am I Losing my Mind or Just my Figure\" was selected as part of the pick of the Edinburgh Festival Pleasance Fringe in 2001. The comedian and writer Nick Revell selected it as part of his pick of the week on BBC Radio Scotland, and it garnered four stars in The Scotsman."

  "text" : "Simon Lack (19 December 1913 – 8 August 1980) was a Scottish actor, working mostly in England. He was born Alexander MacAlpine, in Cleland, Lanarkshire, Scotland. Known locally as Alec, he was the youngest child and only son of his father, Alexander McAlpine (known as Sandy) and his mother Euphemia Ritchie. His sisters were Charlotte (Lottie), Mary, Euphemia (Euphie), Agnes (Nan) and Jenny. Another sister, Jessie, died in childhood. Sandy McAlpine was a stonemason, but worked down the mines when there was no masonry work available, making Simon Lack's later role in Proud Valley particularly poignant to those who knew him from his youth. Euphemia Ritchie's family were somewhat wealthier, but she was disowned on account of her choice of husband, and the family lived for many years in a one-room flat (known in Scottish working class language as a 'single end'), although it seems eventually one of her uncles relented and came to their aid. Alec's earliest ventures into acting were in local theatres. He seems to have chosen the pseudonym Simon Lack when he embarked upon the London stage. He lost five years during the Second World War (as did so many British actors). He served in the European theatre, and was present at Monte Cassino. After the war he returned to acting, getting back into stage work. He was also a member of the BBC Radio company during the late 1950s/early 1960s, and notably guest-starred in all but two of the Paul Temple serials (mysteries) that starred Peter Coke and Marjorie Westbury. His television roles included two Doctor Who serials; The Mind of Evil (1971) and The Androids of Tara (1978). He also guest-starred in episodes of The Saint, Jason King, and Doomwatch. He had co-starring roles in Telford's Change, Enemy at the Door and The Borgias."

  "text" : "Stig Gunnar Lasseby (March 5, 1925 – December 8, 1996) was a Swedish animator, director and producer. Through his company Team Film he played an important role in the history of Swedish animation. Lasseby was born in Gällivare and was educated as a teacher of drawing. In 1955, with two classmates, he founded the animation studio AB Team Film, which by 1966 made him one of Sweden's best known animators. In 1972 the company produced Agaton Sax och bröderna Max, a television series based on the book of the same name by Nils-Olof Franzén, one of the series about the detective Agaton Sax. In 1976 they produced a series of three short films for television about Agaton Sax, and also Agaton Sax and the Byköpings Village Festival, the first full-length entirely animated Swedish film, co-produced by the Swedish Film Institute. Team Film went on to produce two further full-length animated features, Peter-No-Tail (1981), which was a critical and popular success and was also released in several other countries, and Peter-No-Tail in Americat (1985), which had faster action and for which some of the animation and coloring was outsourced to Prague; it made less money and received a mixed critical reception. Team Film also produced a series for small children, Totte (1973), based on books by Gunilla Wolde, and three shorts based on other children's books, Kattresan (1982), Sjörövarfilmen (1983), and Musikbussen (1994), the first two again sponsored by the Swedish Film Institute. Lasseby also voiced Tänkande August, the computer, in the Agaton Sax films and TV series. Lasseby created an animation school in Eksjö; in 1996 this became the first college-level animation training program in Sweden. He died in 1996 in Hult."

His final appearance in the media was in the television series Baby Blues, which ended its run on 9 September 2005.

  "text" : "(This is a Chinese name; the family name is Lee.) Lee Jun-fan (Chinese: 李振藩; November 27, 1940 – July 20, 1973), known professionally as Bruce Lee, was a Hong Kong and American actor, martial artist, philosopher, filmmaker, and founder of the martial art Jeet Kune Do. Lee was the son of Cantonese opera star Lee Hoi-Chuen. He is widely considered by commentators, critics, media, and other martial artists to be one of the most influential martial artists of all time, and a pop culture icon of the 20th century. He is often credited with helping to change the way Asians were presented in American films. Lee was born in Chinatown, San Francisco on November 27, 1940 to parents from Hong Kong and was raised in Kowloon, Hong Kong with his family until his late teens. He was introduced to the film industry by his father and appeared in several films as a child actor. Lee moved to the United States at the age of 18 to receive his higher education, at the University of Washington, at Seattle and it was during this time that he began teaching martial arts. His Hong Kong and Hollywood-produced films elevated the traditional Hong Kong martial arts film to a new level of popularity and acclaim, sparking a surge of interest in Chinese martial arts in the West in the 1970s. The direction and tone of his films changed and influenced martial arts and martial arts films in the US, Hong Kong and the rest of the world. He is noted for his roles in five feature-length films: Lo Wei's The Big Boss (1971) and Fist of Fury (1972); Golden Harvest's Way of the Dragon (1972), directed and written by Lee; Golden Harvest and Warner Brothers' Enter the Dragon (1973) and The Game of Death (1978), both directed by Robert Clouse. Lee became an iconic figure known throughout the world, particularly among the Chinese, as he portrayed Chinese nationalism in his films. He trained in the art of Wing Chun and later combined his other influences from various sources, in the spirit of his personal martial arts philosophy, which he dubbed Jeet Kune Do (The Way of the Intercepting Fist). Lee held dual nationality of Hong Kong and the US. He died in Kowloon Tong on July 20, 1973 at the age of 32."

  "text" : "Babette Bardot (born 1940) is the stage name of a Swedish actress who appeared in Russ Meyer's films, including Common Law Cabin and Mondo Topless. After attracting attention for her roles in Russ Meyer's films, Babette Bardot began touring the United States in 1968 as a burlesque dancer under the guidance of her husband and manager, Bob Baker. With the seductive coif of platinum blonde hair and the billing caption \"44-24-38 World's Most Sensational Exotic Entertainer\" her appearances included the Gayety Theatre in New York, the Town Theatre in Chicago and the Colony Club in Dallas. While covering the burlesque circuit, she became a frequent guest on TV and radio programs, including the Wally Phillips Show (WGN-Chicago), The Steve Allen Show and The Phil Donahue Show. She toured in a number of countries, and later found a home at the Majestic Inn (on MacLeod Trail and 50th Ave South) in Calgary, Alberta. The liberal stripping laws in Alberta allowed her to fully strip; however Babette would only remove her tops while retaining a thong. She was the headliner for the hotel bar, the Majic Stik, opening during the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede to a packed house nightly for six months before departing for Las Vegas. Although unconfirmed, Babette claimed that she was a distant relative of Brigitte Bardot and had once modeled for Pablo Picasso while in her late teens. During the Vietnam War, her popularity and public notoriety resulted in a photo insertion in the GI newspaper Stars and Stripes."

She turned it down and the part was given to Prunella Scales. She played a radical English teacher, Judy Threadgold, opposite Alun Armstrong’s woodwork teacher in Alan Plater’s Get Lost! for Yorkshire Television, shown in 1981. Armstrong was unavailable for a sequel, so it was completely recast and became The Beiderbecke Affair with the parts going to Barbara Flynn and James Bolam. Turner died on 27 December 2014 in Dorchester at the age of 75, and was survived by her husband, Frank Cox. She was also godmother to actor Tom Burke."

  "text" : "William James Hung (born January 13, 1983), also known as Hung Hing Cheong, is a Hong Kong-born American former singer who gained fame in early 2004 as a result of his off-key audition performance of Ricky Martin's hit song \"She Bangs\" on the third season of the television series American Idol. At the time of his audition, Hung was a civil engineering student at UC Berkeley. After his spirited audition to be the next American Idol, he inadvertently won the support of many fans. Hung voluntarily left university to pursue a music career. His recording career was marked by constant negative critical reaction, and his fame became the subject of much controversy as both he and his fans were accused of promoting and endorsing racial stereotypes against Asians, as he was perceived to lack musical talent and be celebrated only for embodying these stereotypes. In spite of the criticism and the implications of his success, he only showed signs of thoroughly enjoying his celebrity, believing he was living his dream. He brought his own career as a musician to an end when in 2011 he accepted a job opportunity as a technical crime analyst for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, and decided to pursue law enforcement instead of music. Since then, Hung has reflected positively on his pop music career."

In 2004, he starred in a self-penned one man show called Jackson's Way at the Edinburgh Fringe. The intended run for the production was ten days, before the intervention of comedian Stewart Lee. Lee was so impressed by Adamsdale's work that he reportedly threw his full support behind Jackson's Way, lobbying for an extension of the run and using his clout within the industry to garner notice from critics and award committees. Adamsdale secured the Perrier Comedy Award for comedy. Adamsdale has since created several new shows: The Receipt, The Human Computer, and The Summer House. The Receipt, a collaboration with sonic artist Chris Branch, used innovative sound effects to punctuate a story about the little man in the big city. It ran at the Edinburgh Fringe 2006, winning a Fringe First and a Total Theatre Award. It subsequently toured nationally, and internationally to the Melbourne Comedy Festival and 59E59 Theatres in New York. In The Human Computer, Adamsdale, a self-confessed technophobe, explored the world of computers. The show premiered in the new Traverse 3 venue at the Edinburgh Fringe 2007. He made his film acting debut in The Boat That Rocked as Newsreader John, in 2009. He is now a regular cast member of the Channel 4 2011 series Campus, playing Jason the University accountant."

This became a pattern, in that he was cast as the villain in the majority of his movies, with Martial Club being a famous exception. In 1985, Wang moved behind the camera, choreographing fight scenes, writing, and directing many movies such as Hong Kong Godfather. He has recently retired from the industry."

  "text" : "Zhang Yimou (Mandarin pronunciation: [tʂɑ́ŋ îmɤ̌ʊ̯], JONG EE-moe; born 14 November 1951) is a Chinese film director, producer, writer and actor, and former cinematographer. He is counted amongst the Fifth Generation of Chinese filmmakers, having made his directorial debut in 1987 with Red Sorghum. Zhang has won numerous awards and recognitions, with Best Foreign Film nominations for Ju Dou in 1990, Raise the Red Lantern in 1991, and Hero in 2003, Silver Lion and Golden Lion prizes at the Venice Film Festival, Grand Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, and the Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival. In 1993, he was a member of the jury at the 43rd Berlin International Film Festival. Zhang directed the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympic Games, which received considerable international acclaim. One of Zhang's recurrent themes is the resilience of Chinese people in the face of hardship and adversity, a theme which has been explored in such films as, for example, To Live (1994) and Not One Less (1999). His films are particularly noted for their rich use of colour, as can be seen in some of his early films, like Raise the Red Lantern, and in his wuxia films like Hero and House of Flying Daggers. His most recent film is a historical drama film called Coming Home."

  "text" : "(This is a Chinese name; the family name is Cheung.) Leslie Cheung Kwok-wing (12 September 1956 – 1 April 2003) was a Hong Kong singer, actor and film producer. He is considered \"one of the founding fathers of Cantopop\" by \"combining a hugely successful film and music career.\" He rose to prominence as a teen heartthrob and pop icon of Hong Kong in the 1980s, receiving numerous music awards including both Most Popular Male Artist Awards at the 1988 and 1989 Jade Solid Gold Best Ten Music Awards. In 1989, Cheung announced his retirement from the music industry as a pop singer. Returning to the music scene after a five-year hiatus, Cheung released his chart-topping comeback album Most Beloved (寵愛) which achieved a huge market success. In 1999, he won the Golden Needle Award for his outstanding achievement as a musician at the RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards, and his 1984 hit song Monica was voted as Hong Kong's \"Song of the Century\". He was honoured as \"Asia's Biggest Superstar\" at the 2000 CCTV-MTV Music Honours. Cheung won the 1991 Hong Kong Film Award (Days of Being Wild) and the 1994 Hong Kong Film Critics Society Award (Ashes of Time) for best actor. He had also won the 1994 Japan Film Critics Society Award for best actor for his performance in Farewell My Concubine and ten other best actor nominations, five Golden Horse Awards, three Cannes Film Festival Awards, a Asia Pacific Film Festival Award, and a Venice Film Festival Award. Cheung's music and movies not only captured fans in Hong Kong but also other Asian areas including Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, China, Japan and South Korea. He is the first foreign artist to hold 16 concerts in Japan that has yet to be broken and the record holder as the best-selling C-pop artist in Korea. Cheung was ranked as the favourite actor in the 100 years of Chinese cinema. In 2010, he was voted the third \"Most Iconic Musicians of All Time\" (after Michael Jackson and The Beatles). CNN considered Cheung as the \"Most Beautiful Man from Hong Kong Cinema\" and one of \"Asia's 25 Greatest Actors of All Time.\" Cheung committed suicide on April 1, 2003 by jumping off the 24th floor of the Mandarin Oriental hotel in Hong Kong. A suicide note left by Cheung stated that he had been suffering from depression."

  "text" : "Hubert Gregg (14 July 1914 – 30 March 2004) was a BBC broadcaster, writer and stage actor. At the end of his life he was probably best known for the BBC Radio 2 \"oldies\" shows A Square Deal and Thanks for the Memory. In an earlier era he had also been a novelist, a theatre director and a hit songwriter. Born in Islington, London, he worked for the BBC from the 1930s onwards, wrote the wartime hit \"I'm Going To Get Lit Up When The Lights Go up in London\" in 1943, and on seeing the German doodlebugs flying over London, composed the song \"Maybe It's Because I'm A Londoner\", which became a hit and London folk anthem in 1947. Gregg spoke German fluently, and during the war worked for the BBC German service, to such good effect that Goebbels assumed he must be a German traitor. He was married three times: his first wife was musical comedy star Zoe Gail, with whom he had a daughter, actress-writer Stacey Gregg; his second wife was the actress and singer Pat Kirkwood; and finally in 1980 he married Carmel Lytton with whom he had two more children."

  "text" : "Hsiao Ho, (Hsiao Hou) (Chinese: 小侯; Cantonese: Siu Hau, born 1 January 1958 in Meixian District, Guangdong, China) is a Hong Kong martial arts film actor, stunt performer and action choreographer. A Hakka, he has acted in many films directed by Lau Kar-leung, including Mad Monkey Kung Fu and Legendary Weapons of China. In 1985 he portrayed legendary kung fu warrior Fong Sai-Yuk in the Lau directed action-comedy, Disciples of the 36th Chamber and also took a lead role in Fake Ghost Catchers, directed by Lau Kar Wing. Fake Ghost Catchers is marketed by Celestial Pictures as being made two years before Ghostbusters (inferring that the idea for Ghostbusters may have come from the movie). Hou is also known for portraying the \"disfigured swordsman\" and doubling complicated action scenes in 1993's Iron Monkey. He was also the action director for the movie Shaolin Avengers (1994). In 1982 he was nominated for Best Action Choreography for the movie Legendary Weapons of China (for which he was action director) at the Hong Kong Film Awards alongside Lau Kar Leung and Ching Chu who also provided choreography for the film. Born Hao Yiu Chung, he was trained in Beijing opera by Fan Kuk-Fa as a child and acted in films. He moved to the United States in the 1960s with classmates where he learned acrobatics from different instructors under the watchful tutelage of Fan Kuk-Fa. He later returned to China, and at age 17 became a martial arts stunt performer, which led to his starring role in Mad Monkey Kung Fu in 1979. He then became a contracted actor with Shaw Brothers Studio and studied Hung Gar, a specialised Kung Fu under Lau Kar Leung. A very young man at the time, he was always cast by director Lau Kar Leung as the rebellious teen. In the cult classic My Young Auntie Hou played the energetic rebellious teenage son of Lau Kar Leung. In Disciples of the 36th Chamber he also played the rebellious son. Because of an ability to perform difficult stunts and acrobats with ease, Hsiao Hou was often cast in roles that required an expert stunt performer and martial artist. While his career did not reach the popularity of frequent co-stars Gordon Liu or Kara Hui, he is considered a Shaw Brothers legend by legions of fans and is highly regarded for martial arts, comedic talents, and acrobatic talent. Lau Kar Leung was once quoted as calling Hou the most \"talented action actor (or star)\" in his class. Hsiao Hou's last known interview was in 2004 taken by Video Asia. Though he was not featured on the cover in western versions of the popular Shaw Brother releases, Hsiao Hou took the starring roles in Mad Monkey Kung Fu, Legendary Weapons of China, Disciples of the 36th Chamber, Fake Ghost Catchers and My Young Auntie. He later acted in small supporting roles in films by Sammo Hung. He has also been a martial arts and action director/choreographer."

He was educated at Charterhouse School and a graduate of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. His first marriage was to the actress Valerie Taylor. In his book The Stage Struck Me! fellow actor Neville Phillips felt Sinclair always played variations of himself, handsome, debonair, suave and witty and excelled in light comedy. By contrast Phillips felt his wife, who Sinclair often appeared opposite, was a dramatic actress of tremendous power with a magnificent voice. Sinclair appeared both on Broadway and on the West End. His screen work began in British films. His most notable role possibly is Leslie Charteris' The Saint in The Saint's Vacation followed by The Saint Meets the Tiger. Sinclair died in Slapton, England at the age of 59."

  "text" : "(This is a Chinese name; the family name is Mui.) Anita Mui Yim Fong (10 October 1963 – 30 December 2003) was a Hong Kong singer and actress. During her prime years, Mui made major contributions to the Cantopop music scene while receiving numerous awards and honours. She remained an idol throughout most of her career, and was generally regarded as a Cantopop diva. Mui once held a sold-out concert in Hammersmith, London, England, where she was dubbed the \"Madonna of Asia (東方麥當娜)\", which brought her to further international fame. That title stayed with her throughout her career, and has been used as a comparison for both Eastern and Western media. In the 1980s, the gangtai style of music was revolutionised by Mui's wild dancing and on-stage femininity. She was famed for her outrageous costumes and high-power performances in combination with contralto vocals, which are rare in female artists. Her fan base reached far beyond Hong Kong into many parts of Asia, including Taiwan, mainland China, Singapore and Malaysia, and other countries as well. In the Hong Kong entertainment industry, where stars often rise and fall quickly, Mui remained in the spotlight for 21 years (1982–2003). Her career came to a halt abruptly in 2003 when she announced that she had cervical cancer. She died later that year at the age of 40. Mui's continuing commemoration by the Hong Kong entertainment industry was due not only to her music and film legacies, but also her involvement in charity and humanitarian work."

  "text" : "Annalisa Ericson (14 September 1913 – 21 April 2011) was a Swedish actress best known for her roles in 58 Swedish movies between 1930 and 1991. The core of her acting work though took place on various theatres in Stockholm. Starting with ballet in 1919, she made her first work on the stage at the Royal Opera in Stockholm. After quitting the ballet in 1930, she became an acting student and made her first appearances in various plays and revues. Her first break in the movies was Värmlänningarna in 1932. Mixing revues with light comedy films, she slowly gained herself a name. In the 1940s she appeared in a number of musicals with actor Nils Poppe where the couple became known for their acrobatic dancing."

He exhibits regularly in Mayfair, London and Dublin, Ireland Murphy was a child-actor, his roles including the eponymous hero in the British television serial, Tom Brown's Schooldays (1971), which won Emmys for Murphy as 'Best Lead Actor in a Miniseries' for his role as Tom Brown and as 'Best Miniseries' after it was screened by PBS in 1973. Despite the critical acclaim, he never again worked as an actor. Murphy attended New College at Oxford University from 1970-1975 to study Philosophy, Psychology and Physiology. He then married his first wife and moved to Ireland, working as a potter and an aerial photographer. But after four years Murphy divorced, and subsequently he returned to school to study law. Despite lacking passion for the law, Murphy pursued a career as a corporate lawyer, first in England then in Paris, France. In Paris he met and married his second wife. Murphy began to paint “to relieve the boredom of corporate law.” Murphy’s first painting exhibition in 1991 in London was a great success, and his colorful Gauguin-esque paintings became highly desirable. In 1992, Murphy and his new wife relocated from Paris to a large country house near Carcassonne in the south of France. He continues to paint and exhibit work, but he rarely leaves the Languedoc."

(The producers had said in an interview that they had promised Bugeja a role after she stood in for someone at a read-through, but were forced to give her only a small part as Respectable was taking up most of her time.) She appeared in over two dozen British TV commercials, notably the award-winning campaign for Sure antiperspirant with the punchline \"Thank god you dumped him first!\", and a hugely successful campaign for Yakult yoghurt drink. She had guest roles in The Bill once in 2005, where she appeared as the girlfriend of a man who was holding his dad and three officers hostage at St Hugh's and the second time in 2007 when she appeared in three episodes as Nina Lloyd, the ex partner of CPS solicitor Matt Hinkley who had driven her to a mental breakdown. She has also appeared in Agatha Christie's Poirot as Lilly Luxmore, in Cards on the Table in 2006; the 2008 British movie The Crew as Debs and in the Doctors episode Someone Else's Shoes as Branwen Owen in 2013."

Productions included Black-Eyed Susan by Douglas Jerrold, Wives as they Were and Maids as they Are by Elizabeth Inchbald, The London Merchant by George Lillo and the world premiere of Inchbald's The Massacre two centuries after it was written. In addition there were public readings of some seventy five plays by authors as diverse as Hannah Cowley and John le Planché, Since 2012 he has resumed a freelance career as well as being the Artistic Director of The Production Exchange a theatre production charity whose objective is to provide support, mentoring and opportunities for early-career practitioners in Theatre and Dance.

She made more than 230 films in a variety of genres: from traditional Cantonese opera and wuxia movies to contemporary youth musicals; action films to comedies; melodramas and romances. Owing to her popularity she was dubbed \"The Movie-Fan Princess\". Her godfather is actor Cho Tat Wah.

  "text" : "Chai Tian Bian or better known as Chen Tianwen (Chinese: 陈天文; Wade–Giles: Ch'en2 T'ien1 Wen2) is a Singaporean veteran actor. He starred in many Mandarin dramas throughout the 1990s, and his film credits include the Cannes Film Festival award-winning Ilo Ilo, Ah Boys to Men, Ah Boys to Men 2, Ah Boys to Men 3: Frogmen, The Lion Men, The Lion Men: Ultimate Showdown and Mr. Unbelievable. Chen was educated at the now defunct Serangoon Garden Secondary Technical School. He joined the SBC after completing the 5th artiste drama training class and made his debut in 1984. He holds a black belt in taekwondo and his martial arts background led him to being cast in many wuxia dramas in the 1990s and as characters with fight scenes in other drama series. He is also a member of the Singapore Celebrity Soccer Team. The Straits Times remarked that Chen's \"much-praised understated turn\" in the Cannes Film Festival award-winning Ilo Ilo put him in the spotlight once again. Chen hit the headlines again when two parody music videos he starred in, went viral. The first, titled \"Unbelievable\", was 'lauded' for the nonsensical line 'I so stunned like vegetable' (sic), drawing the attention of TIME, while the second, \"Sandcastle in My Heart\", in which Irene Ang also starred in, did not become as popular as the previous one. Both videos are a parody of popular Chinese MVs in the 1970s, particularly the work of Singaporean singer Huang Ching Yuan."

Dixon's most notable role was in the 1981 BBC TV series The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, in which he starred as Ford Prefect. He also received critical acclaim for his portrayal of Ariel in the 1980 BBC version of The Tempest (directed by John Gorrie). He would later rejoin the Hitchhiker's Guide by lending his voice to the \"Ecological Man\" and the \"Zirzla Leader\" in Fit the Twentieth of the radio series, while Geoffrey McGivern, who had originally played the character on radio, returned to the role of Ford. Despite a relatively sparse TV and film career, David Dixon has over the years acquired a loyal fan following online who call themselves \"Dixonites\"."

  "text" : "(This is a Chinese name; the family name is Wong.) Dayo Wong Tze-wah (born 5 September 1960) is a Hong Kong stand-up comedian, actor, presenter, screenwriter, and singer, who is the pioneer of stand-up comedy in Hong Kong. Wong gained a degree in philosophy from the University of Alberta in Canada. He began his career in the entertainment industry in Hong Kong in 1984, but he is best known for his works in live stand-up comedy which he started performing regularly since 1990. Since then he has starred in TV dramas and films, and recorded his own album. Dayo had his TVB TV series debut in 1999, acting as \"Lai Sam\" in \"Justice Sung 2\". A year later, he reached a milestone of his TV series career. Dayo as a lazy office assistant in a law firm in War of the Gender, winning the My Favourite Television Character Award in 2002. It is when his flame reached his highest point. 2004 was a fruitful year for Dayo as it was when he won two awards: the My Favourite On-Screen Partners (with Ada Choi in \"Catch the Uncatchable\") and again, the My Favourite Television Character Award (also in \"Catch the Uncatchable\"). He was so close to the \"TV King\" Award (The Best Actor Award). He was on the nomination list of the award in both 2007 and 2009. He was finally crowned as TV King with \"Bounty Lady\" in 2013. To Dayo, the award was an accumulative result of his TVB dramas. He also revealed that his relationship with Chilam were like cousins. In that year, Chilam Cheung started as the clear favourite of the audience due to his absolute popularity starring as Captain Cool in \"Triumph in the Skies 2\". Though Chilam ended up winning the Most Popular Male Character, he sounded disappointed in his acceptance speech (the price is widely recognised as a consolation prize to The Best Actor Award). Chilam did not stay behind the ceremony for the TVB official interview. He explained that he was not informed to stay behind for any interview. The discord rumours between Chilam and Dayo begin to spread out widely. However, the rumour was shot down when Chilam surprised Dayo by his sudden appearance at a meal gathering of the Bounty Lady. Besides the TVB drama career, Dayo is also well known to be a stand-up comedian. He introduced stand up comedy to Hong Kong. He has done thirteen stand up comedy routines so far, mainly targeting local Hong Kongnese. Unlike Northern American stand-up comedians, his jokes usually includes a lot of political and philosophical content, which brings up a high level of consonant among audience. \"Hong Kong's housing issue is absolutely ridiculous. I have discussed this in my stand-up shows too. Hong Kong residents need to have 13 to 14 times their current annual salary to finally be qualified for home ownership.\" said the comedian. Up to 2013, he has done as much as thirteen shows. Seven of them were also performed in Australia, Canada and the United States. Dayo's latest talk show was performed on October 2014. A month later, the show was brought to Canada and the United States as well. In comparison with his stand-up comedy and TV dramas, his movies are not as successful. When being asked the reasons behind, he explained that his ultimate goal is to look for something new in his movies. His visions makes his work good to watch, but it is not good enough to attract people to pay for a cinema ticket. The second reason is that he hates doing promotion for his work."

Rye had two sons from her first marriage, actor Michael Culver and painter Robin Culver. In 1963, with the backing of friends, Rye established a restaurant in Chelsea called Daphne's, which became a celebrity hangout, attracting the likes of Laurence Olivier, David Niven, Alec Guinness and Prince Charles. She died in Spain where she had spent much of her life."

  "text" : "Faye Wong (born 8 August 1969) is a Chinese singer-songwriter and actress, often referred to as a \"diva\" (Chinese: 天后; literally: \"Heavenly Queen\") in Chinese-language media. Early in her career she briefly used the stage name Shirley Wong. Born in Beijing, she moved to British Hong Kong in 1987 and came to public attention in the early 1990s by singing ballads in Cantonese. Since 1994 she has recorded mostly in her native Mandarin, often combining alternative music with mainstream Chinese pop. In 2000 she was recognised by Guinness World Records as the Best Selling Canto-Pop Female. Following her second marriage in 2005 she withdrew from the limelight, but returned to the stage in 2010 amidst immense interest in the Sinophone world. Hugely popular in Mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore, she has also gained a large following in Japan. In the West she is perhaps best known for starring in Wong Kar-wai's films Chungking Express and 2046. While she has collaborated with international artists such as Cocteau Twins, Wong recorded only a few songs in English, including \"Eyes on Me\" – the theme song of the video game Final Fantasy VIII. Wong is known to be reserved in public, and has gained a reputation for her \"coolness\". In Encyclopedia of Contemporary Chinese Culture, Jeroen de Kloet characterised her as \"singer, actress, mother, celebrity, royalty, sex symbol and diva all at the same time\"."

  "text" : "Forbes Collins is a versatile British character actor, seen in supporting roles. The serious demeanour he gives to some of the 'country-fied' characters he has played is lent gravity via a down-to-earth manner combined with his trademark serious expression. He is best known for his role as King John in the popular comedy Maid Marian and Her Merry Men. He also starred in the episode All About Scoring, Innit? in the critically acclaimed drama, Minder, playing Arklow, as well as appearing as Jonas in Jesus of Nazareth, some episodes of the first series of Blackadder, and playing the Chief Officer in Doctor Who's Vengeance on Varos. Collins also played Zacky Martin in Poldark (1975), playing a leading male member in the village of Sawle and supporter of Captain Poldark, whose house Nampara was nearby. When the villagers of Sawle try one of their own for murder, Zacky is prominent in leading the process, advocating using \"the old way\". This uses a candle which, should it stop burning before the end, is taken as 'proof' of guilt. In Poldark, with 'sentence' passed, as the 'guilty' man (who professes his genuine guilt) is taken away, the viewer sees that the wick in the candle had been pre-cut, and the flame would have naturally extinguished anyway. In the quietly memorable and chilling scene that follows, the 'guilty' man is hurled from the cliffs to his death. Other appearances include the 1974 \"Dixon Of Dock Green\" episode, \"Seven For A Secret - Never To Be Told\". His character, Pengelly, appears to have withheld information from Dock Green police who are investigating the death of a woman in a gas explosion. He has also played policemen himself, notably Chief Superintendent Bailey in three episodes of the P. D. James-penned Adam Dalgliesh story, \"Shroud For A Nightingale\" (which TV mini-series starred Roy Marsden as Dalgliesh)."

Born in Ipoh, Malaysia, she was chosen by People as one of the \"50 Most Beautiful People in the World\" in 1997. She is best known in the Western world for her roles in the 1997 James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies, playing Wai Lin, and the multiple Academy Award–winning Chinese-language martial arts film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, for which she was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in 2000. In 2008, the film critic website Rotten Tomatoes ranked her the greatest action heroine of all time. In 2009, she was listed by People magazine – as the only Asian actress – as one of the \"35 All-Time Screen Beauties\". She is credited as Michelle Khan in some of her earlier films. This alias was chosen by the D&B studio who thought it might be more marketable to international and western audiences. Yeoh later preferred using her real name."

Some of her most commercially successful work was in the action genre, but Cheung once said in an interview that of all the work she has done, the films that really meant something to her are Song of Exile, Centre Stage, Comrades: Almost a Love Story and In the Mood for Love. As Emily Wang in Clean, her last starring role to date, she became the first Asian actress to win a prize at the Cannes Film Festival."

He appeared in the 12-episode Children's Film Foundation series The Magnificent Six and a Half before playing the bespectacled \"Brains\" in Here Come the Double Deckers (1970–71). In the film Young Winston (1971) he played Winston Churchill as a schoolboy. As the 1970s progressed, Audreson's appearances reduced significantly, but he had a role in two episodes of The Tomorrow People (1978) television series. In 1996 he founded Rivendell Healthcare, a drug and alcohol addiction treatment centre. Audreson wrote and directed two short films: The Man Who Could Read Minds (1999) and Eve Buckingham (2001) starring Susan Hampshire. His feature film The 10 Arenas of Marwood (2010), which he wrote and directed, starred Judi Bowker, John Hasler, Kate G. Laycy, Michael Mayne, Bryan Murray, Lucy Russell, Issy Van Randwyck, Emma Williams and Peter Wickham as Marwood. In 2015, he founded a media production and distribution company, 10am Transmedia, which specialises in Transmedia storytelling. Its first project is called Don't Get Mad."

He was educated at Radley College and studied law at the University of London before enlisting in the British Army in 1939. After spending five years as a prisoner of war, Langham set his sights on the theatre and led several repertory theatres in the U.K. including Coventry (1946–48), Birmingham (1948–50) and Glasgow (1953–54). He was the second artistic director at the Stratford Festival in Canada from 1956 to 1967, and the third artistic director of the Guthrie Theater from 1971 to 1977. He was also director of the Juilliard School from 1979 to 1982, and again from 1987 to 1992. Langham's association with the Stratford Festival lasted over a half century as he directed Love's Labours Lost and There Reigns Love for the 2008 season. In 1995 he directed two plays for the inaugural season of the Atlantic Theatre Festival in Wolfville, Nova Scotia. Langham was married to actress Helen Burns. Their son is the writer, actor and comedian Chris Langham. Langham died on 15 January 2011 in Cranbrook, Kent, England after a short illness."

  "text" : "Alyssa Meilin Gray is an American-Chinese pop singer and songwriter, based in Beijing, China. Meilin first appeared on Chinese national and worldwide television in 2006 with her younger sister, Suelin, winning first place on Beijing Television’s ‘Arts of Our Land’ competition, performing a traditional Chinese ‘hulusi’ flute duet. BTV’s Arts of Our Land competition (Wai Guo Ren Zhong Hua Cai Yi Da Sai), was China’s then-premier international competition for foreigners to showcase their talents in traditional Chinese art and culture. Following success on BTV’s ‘Arts of Our Land’, Meilin entered China Central Television’s ‘Xing Guang Da Dao’ Star Search competition, China’s foremost national talent competition, where she won first place in both the weekly and monthly competitions. In 2007, Meilin (梅琳) and Hong Kong singer and actor, Nicholas Tse, recorded the theme song and music video for Walt Disney’s Mandarin language release of the film ‘Beauty and the Beast’, which gave Meilin her first commercial success, with the song reaching No.2 on Pepsi’s Chinese Billboard Pop Charts."

Known for reinventing both her music and image, she is cited as a huge role of popularizing dance music as mainstream music in Greater China. Often referred to as the \"Queen of C-pop\", \"Asia's Dancing Queen\" and \"Asian Madonna\", she has achieved popularity in Chinese-speaking countries by releasing a series of commercially and critically successful albums and has a dedicated fanbase worldwide. Born and raised in Taiwan, Tsai began her singing career by winning the champion at an MTV singing competition at the age of 18. Her debut album, released in 1999 and entitled 1019, was a huge success, and she quickly became a teen idol with a large teenage fanbase. Her fifth album, Magic (2003), is regarded as one of her biggest successes so far, right after her album, Dancing Diva (2006), which sold over 2.5 million copies in Asia. After several successful albums and dozens of hits, she released her latest album, Play, in 2014. Having sold more than 25 million records in Asia, Tsai is recognized as one of the best-selling artists in Asia. Her work has earned her numerous awards and accolades, including six Golden Melody Awards, an MTV Asia Award and an MTV Video Music Award. She has been acclaimed as an entrepreneur, particularly after she founded her own music production and management company Eternal in 2009. Forbes reported that she is one of the highest-paid Chinese celebrities, with the estimated net worth of NT$2 billion in 2014."

  "text" : "Jia Hongsheng (simplified Chinese: 贾宏声; traditional Chinese: 賈宏聲; pinyin: Jiǎ Hóngshēng; 19 March 1967 – 5 July 2010) was a Chinese actor who became known in the late 1980s and early 1990s for roles in movies like The Case of the Silver Snake (1988), Good Morning, Beijing (1991), A Woman from North Shaanxi (1993) and Weekend Lover (1995). His performances were praised by critics and he developed a rebellious image that made him popular among artistic youth and the \"Sixth Generation\" of Chinese directors. However, he backed away from the limelight in 1995 after becoming addicted to cannabis and eventually heroin. His father, head of the local theatre in Jilin, retired two years before his retirement age, and along with his wife moved to Beijing to try to help Jia. He made a comeback in 2000, starring in the celebrated Suzhou River. The following year he starred in the film he is best known for to Western audiences, the autobiographical Quitting. It depicts his battle with addiction and his family trying to help him sober up, with all of the cast members being real people playing themselves."

  "text" : "Yam Kim Fai (Chinese: 任劍輝, 4 February 1913 (Lunar 29 December 1912) – 29 November 1989), also known as Ren Jianhui was a renowned Cantonese opera actress in China and Hong Kong. She was most notable for her unique ability to sing in the lower register. That her opera voice was indistinguishable from a male one allowed her to play either male or female roles, though she usually performed male ones. Miss Universe 1976, the 25th Miss Universe pageant, was held on 11 July 1976 at the Lee Theatre in Hong Kong. From five portraits, contestants were asked to pick one that she/they could identify, as the only actress instead of an actor, in Cantonese opera costume. Yam was not the one she/they picked. In 1972, TV viewers looked for the \"man\" they knew from movies/stage performances when Yam performed the last time in public. They did not expect to see her in a 2-piece set of jacket and qipao (cheongsam) with floral print. Since 1972, Yam enjoyed singing in private with a live band and was often accompanied by her protégée Loong who would read the lyrics out for her until her eyesight improved with surgery."

Previously known for his explosive speed and power, he won numerous national and international competitions in the eighties and early nineties, including the first Asian Games in 1990. He is considered by many as a bridge between traditional Chinese martial arts and modern wushu for his successful integration of traditional and modern techniques at a level of fluidity, technique, and explosiveness that had not been seen before, and which has yet to have been matched today. He is a former Shanxi wushu team athlete trained by the coaches Pang Lin Tai and Zhang Ling Mei. He became the standard that other athletes were judged by in the nineties: his personal long fist and staff forms were famously made into the compulsory wushu guiding forms which other athletes had to perform and compete in."

  "text" : "Norman Evans (11 June 1901 – 25 November 1962) was a variety and radio performer, born in Rochdale, Lancashire, England. Evans was discovered by fellow Rochdale entertainer Gracie Fields. The act for which he is best remembered was \"Over the Garden Wall\", in which he played Fanny Fairbottom, a toothless hatchet-faced Lancastrian housewife gossiping over a garden wall, The routine was the inspiration for Les Dawson and Roy Barraclough's later Cissie and Ada characters. The one-sided conversations would embrace local gossip, including scandal about the neighbours and personal medical complaints, including silently mouthing words deemed too rude to be spoken out loud, and accompanied with a range of facial contortions and glances round for supposed eavesdroppers. Another famous stage sketch was \"The Dentist\" in which Evans played both patient and dentist, and in which he employed a large screen. His first appearance on the London stage was alongside a young Betty Driver. Evans was the only pantomime dame to receive top billing at the London Palladium. His final summer season was at Butlin's Holiday Camp, Pwllheli in 1962. He wrote to Clarkson Rose (another top pantomime dame) \"Working in a Butlin theatre is a terrific experience, and although I've not been too well, I've never been happier in my life\". Norman Evans is buried in Carleton Cemetery, Blackpool. The headstone of his grave is a low wall built from natural gritstone blocks. His epitaph (preceding birth and death dates) reads \"Norman's last garden wall!\""

  "text" : "Norm Grabowski (February 5, 1933 – October 12, 2012) was an American hot rod builder and actor. The heavy set crew cut-wearing Grabowski appeared in minor roles in many films produced by Albert Zugsmith and Walt Disney. He was Polish-American. In 1952, after leaving military service, Grabowski built a hot rod based on a shortened 1922 Ford Model T touring car mated to a similarly extremely shortened Model A pickup truck bed. With a powerful Cadillac overhead valve engine that came from his parents' sedan, the vehicle that resulted had a unique appearance and stance which inspired many hot rods created afterward. The car was first featured on the cover of the October, 1955 issue of Hot Rod Magazine and then underwent further modifications, including a greater rake, tilted windshield and blue paint with flames when it famously appeared in color on the cover of the April, 1957 issue of Car Craft magazine as well as in the April 29, 1957 issue of Life Magazine. Grabowski's hugely influential T-bucket hot rod, which became known as the Kookie Kar, was used in the television show 77 Sunset Strip. The car was owned and driven in the show by the character Kookie who was played by Edd Byrnes. As a consequence of the magazine exposure, Grabowski was approached about renting the car out to appear in movies and television shows. The contacts he made in this way led to an acting career for Grabowski. He appeared in television shows, including The Monkees, Batman (episodes 39 and 40 in 1966) and The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis, and films such as High School Confidential (1958), The Beat Generation (1959), The Big Operator (1959), Girls Town (1959), College Confidential (1960), Sex Kittens Go to College (1960), The Misadventures of Merlin Jones (1964), Roustabout (1964), Girl Happy (1965), The Monkey's Uncle (1965), Out of Sight (1966), Blackbeard's Ghost (1968), The Towering Inferno (1974), Hooper (1978) and The Cannonball Run (1981). Grabowski was known as a wood carver, and many hot rods and custom cars feature his unique hand-carved skull gearshift knobs. He retired from acting in the 1980s after The Cannonball Run. Grabowski died the morning of October 12, 2012, at the age of 79."

His popularity got a further boost when he delivered a sterling performance as Tong Gat in No Regrets.

She remained on the soap for two years between 1998 and 2000. When her contract was not renewed, the character was written out in a scene that saw her commit suicide by jumping in front of a lorry. The scene, watched by 17 million viewers, won Radcliffe the British Soap Award for Best Exit. From 2002 to 2005 she played Jean Bradshaw in the BBC drama Born and Bred. In 2007 she played Bev in the BBC Three situation comedy The Visit."

  "text" : "Norah Gorsen (born 1933 in Devon) is a retired British actress. She had several roles on film and television, including the movies Those People Next Door and Personal Affair (both 1953). On TV, her appearances included Beth in the BBC's 1950 version of Little Women, and in the soap Emergency – Ward 10 in 1958. She also appeared as Lady Rowena in an episode of the 1958 TV adaption of Ivanhoe, as well as appearing in a 1956 episode of The Adventures of Sir Lancelot. However, she has not appeared in any acting role since the 1960s. Possibly her best-known role was in the film Geordie (1955), where she played the title character's girlfriend."
