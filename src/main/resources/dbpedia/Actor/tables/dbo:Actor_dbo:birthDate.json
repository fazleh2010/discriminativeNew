  "text" : "Race Wong is an actress, singer and businesswoman. Born in Malaysia, raised in Singapore, she pursued her career in the entertainment industry in Hong Kong with her sister Rosanne Wong which won her various awards for her singing career as the cantopop group 2R, including Most Promising Newcomer and Most Popular Group Award in the Annual Top 10 Song of the Year Awards (2003), Metro Broadcasting Music awards (2004), TVB Top 10 Songs of the Year (2004) and Hong Kong Commercial Radio Music Awards’ (2003). Race Wong became a spotlight when she was chosen to star alongside Stephen Chow in his famous annual San Miguel TV advertisement. Following that, she rose to fame for her leading role in a TVB youth series Hearts Of Fencing. Which jumpstarted both her singing and acting career. Race Wong hoped to focus her acting on roles beyond her youthful and sweet appearance. Her outstanding performance in her first leading role in movie Abnormal Beauty Abnormal Beauty won her a nomination for the Best New Actor in the 24th Annual Hong Kong Film Awards (2005) and the 42nd Golden Horse Film Awards’ (2005) in Taiwan. Race Wong continued to experiment with different roles both on-screen and off-screen. In 2006, together with her sister Rosanne Wong, they took on groundbreaking leading roles in a musical adaption of The Smiling Proud Wanderer stage performance by the Hong Kong Dance Company (2006) where Rosanne famously shaved bald for the role. The musical enjoyed a success which brought them to perform in Shanghai the following year. Later in 2008, Race Wong’s starring role as a pregnant new immigrant from China was a break away from her usual youthful image in the movie True Women For Sale which earned her a nomination for Best Supporting Actress in the 28th Hong Kong Film Awards (2009). Race is one of the very rare few Singaporeans to have been nominated in the Hong Kong Film Awards. In 2010, Race Wong decided to step out of the limelight for a break. She took on a Masters of Business course to further her education and graduated with a Masters of Business majoring in Marketing from the University of Newcastle (Australia) in 2013. Concurrently in 2011, she made an unexpected career change into finance, taking on the role of Marketing Manager at Maybank Kim Eng Securities (Hong Kong). She was licensed with the Securities and Futures Commission to conduct equities trading. The year she turned 30, Race Wong made a surprising move to relocate back to Singapore where her family is based. Together with her younger sister Rhonda Wong, she set up Anthill Realtors Pte. Ltd. in 2013 a real estate agency licensed with CEA. She then co-founded Ohmyhome Pte Ltd in 2015, a tech company focused on connecting buyers to sellers, landlords to tenants in real estate. When asked about her career move, Race said that she wanted to focus her attention on something that will provide more value to people, something on the opposite spectrum of her celebrity lifestyle. She speaks fluent Cantonese, Mandarin, and English."

Decorated by General Charles de Gaulle, he resumed his acting career immediately after the end of the war. Supported by André Malraux and Albert Camus, he ascended to fame at the Festival de Nîmes, France, in his role of Julius Caesar. After several movies and theater successes, he was offered the Directorship of the fledgling Senegalese National Theater by the King who aspired to a world-class national theater. This culminated in the National Theater of Senegal being the first African Shakespearean to tour major European capitals in 1974.

After reaching preadolescence, her foster mother forced her to enter the Hong Kong movie industry to exploit her.

  "text" : "Polly Duniam (born 15 March 1987 in London, England), also known as Puddle Carrot Gold, is a British actress, dancer and model. Along with her twin sister, Sophie Duniam, she gained fame in the BBC series Home Farm Twins portraying Hannah Moore, one of the twins in the title during the late 1990s. She grew up in Cromer, Norfolk with a love of dancing and singing that stems from her dance instructor mother. This helped both sisters gain a year-long contract with We Will Rock You in their mid teens. Both twins have been touring with the Pet Shop Boys on an 18-month contract.Now committed to their own music, the twins have performed at a number of festivals and venues across Europe under the name of My Bad Sister, combining elements of pop, rap and underground dance music with distinctive mirrored choreography. Recently they have also modelled for contemporary fashion designers like Jylle Navarro and Celia Arias, and featured in Rita Ora's 2014 music video for her number one single I Will Never Let You Down. She appeared on E4's Tattoo Fixers in 2015 to cover up a bad tattoo."

  "text" : "Philip Bowen is a British actor who has appeared in a number of British film and television roles including in Agatha Christie's Poirot, Kavanagh QC and Soldier Soldier. He was born in Sutton Coldfield, Warwickshire, in 1946. Phil’s professional career started at Leatherhead in Puss in Boots playing the back end of the donkey. Seasons in rep followed at Guildford, Derby, Nottingham, Birmingham, Oxford and Newcastle as well as television, radio and some film work in Hollywood. Foreign touring for the British Council, including three years with Sir Michael Redgrave coupled with seasons at Regent’s Park and the Young Vic where he played Hamlet directed by Michael Bogdanov, developed a love for Shakespeare. Associations with Tim Carroll, Master of Verse at Shakespeare’s Globe, included touring Germany and playing Prospero in Maidstone Prison with the inmates playing the other parts. He met his wife, Susannna Best, while they were touring with the English Shakespeare Company and together they set up the charity, Shakespeare Link. Their vision was to access Shakespeare beyond the confines of theatre or academe, as a stimulus for communication and debate. They worked in the community, with therapists, with young people and senior citizens as well as in hospitals and prisons; teaching, directing and performing took them to Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Beirut, the Philippines, Tunisia, Mauritius, Indonesia, Malaysia, the US and Canada.Now settled on the family smallholding in the Upper Wye Valley they have been translating Shakespeare into BSL, working with local schools and groups and running ‘Have-a-go Shakespeare’ sessions with all comers. In 2006 they headed up a team to plant the magical Willow Globe, woven of living willow and open to the sky, which they run both as a producing and a receiving house. Such is the success of the Willow Globe Community Company, under Phil’s guidance, that it has been invited to play CADW heritage sites and, by the RSC, to perform at Stratford. In 1996 Phil founded 'Shakespeare Link' with his wife, Susanna Best (mother of the actress Eve Best), and is focused on broadening the appeal and accessibility of Shakespeare. This work was further extended with the establishment of the Willow Globe theatre on land at their home near Llanwrthwl, Powys in Wales."

At the  Assembly Rooms in York, her performance in Ibsen's Little Eyolf was described by critics as \"genuinely revelatory.\" In 1970 she married David Conville, director of the Open Air Theatre, Regents Park, where she made many of her later stage appearances. Interspersed amongst her stage work were film and TV parts, including starring as the seductive Jane in The Troubleshooters, This Is My Street, Man in a Suitcase, the title role in William Douglas Home's The Reluctant Debutante (ITV Play of the Week), Giants On Saturday, Triangle, Brett, Coronation Street, The Sweeney and the Ruth Rendell thriller A Fatal Inversion.

  "text" : "Geoffrey Beevers (born 15 January 1941) is a British actor who has appeared in many different stage and screen roles. Beevers has worked extensively at the Orange Tree Theatre in Richmond upon Thames, both as an actor (including the title role in Jules Romain's Doctor Knock, 1994); and as an adaptor/director of George Eliot's novel Adam Bede (February 1990), for which he won a Time Out Award, and Balzac's Père Goriot (February 1994). Beevers has made two appearances in the BBC science fiction series Doctor Who, including as the third actor to play the Master in the serial The Keeper of Traken, a role he has since reprised in some of Big Finish Productions' Doctor Who audio dramas (Dust Breeding, Master, Trail of the White Worm, The Oseidon Adventure, Mastermind, And You Will Obey Me, The Two Masters, The Light at the End, The Evil One, Requiem for the Rocket Men and Death Match). Beevers narrated the unabridged audio edition of Doctor Who: Harvest of Time, by Alastair Reynolds, released in June 2013. He also read the AudioGO (and later Audible) audiobooks of Doctor Who and the Terror of the Autons, Doctor Who and the Doomsday Weapon, Doctor Who and the Sea Devils, Doctor Who and the Space War, Doctor Who and the Deadly Assassin, and the upcoming Doctor Who and the State of Decay. He also played the vicar in the film Goodnight Mister Tom, and appeared in the 1978 television film The Nativity. In 1988 he appeared in the TV movie sequel The Great Escape II: The Untold Story, and played Wainwright (Member of Parliament) in A Very British Coup for Channel 4 Television (UK). More recently, he played a small role in the 2010 remake of Clash of the Titans as a noble of Basilica. In February 2010 Beevers played Douglas Hogg in the television film On Expenses. In 2012, Beevers appeared as Fray Antonio in the Royal Shakespeare Company production of Helen Edmundson's The Heresy of Love.

Lam has remained popular in Hong Kong for three decades. He writes a number of his own songs; some of them have also been recorded by other singers including Teresa Carpio, with whom he recorded an album and has given joint concerts, most recently in 2007. In addition to his singing career, Lam has also acted in many films, making his film debut in Luckies Trio in 1978.

Bryan enters the historical record as one of a quintet of English actors who toured Denmark and Saxony in the years 1586 and 1587. He was in the Admiral's Men/Lord Strange's Men production of The Seven Deadly Sins, c. 1591, with Augustine Phillips and William Sly and other future Lord Chamberlain's Men. Bryan may also have toured with the same group of actors under Edward Alleyn in 1593. He is generally believed to have been one of the original members and sharers in the Lord Chamberlain's Men when that company was re-constituted in 1594; he certainly was a key member in 1596, when he and John Heminges received payment for a performance at Court. After that point, however, he apparently left the theatrical profession; he seems to have quit acting around 1597. He hadn't died: in 1603 and in the 1611–13 period, he was recorded as a Groom of the Chamber under James I."

While living with his uncle he reluctantly trained as an engineer at a colliery: it was at the colliery that he first became interested in acting when he organised concerts for the workforce. He won a scholarship to train at RADA while still working at the colliery. In 1938 he married Judith Cope. Working in repertory theatre, his theatrical career was interrupted by World War II during which he served in Burma. Returning to the theatre after the war, he became a playwright and appeared on various TV shows and films. In 1947 he married Helen A. Syme at Cuckfield in Sussex. On Broadway he appeared as Sir Francis Getliffe in The Affair at the Henry Miller Theatre (1962) and as Major Hugh Beresford Maitland in Hostile Witness at the Music Box Theatre (1966). His 1978 farce Caught Napping starred Arthur Lowe, Bill Pertwee and Edward Evans. His best known role was as Captain Square in Dad's Army, the pompous commander of the Eastgate platoon of the Home Guard who was a rival of Captain Mainwaring. Other TV appearances included Rookery Nook, Upstairs, Downstairs, It Ain't Half Hot Mum and Edward & Mrs. Simpson. Lumsden died in London in 1984 aged 69."

  "text" : "Gary Hailes (born 4 November 1965 in London) is an English actor. Hales attended Holloway School. During the 1980s he starred in several successful television series, including Woodentop, Grange Hill and the BBC soap opera EastEnders, where he played Barry Clark from 1986-89. He originally auditioned for the role of Mark Fowler when the series began in 1985, but the role went to David Scarboro instead. Hailes' character was notable for being one half of the soap's first gay couple, introduced as the partner of the yuppie graphic designer, Colin Russell (played by Michael Cashman). In 1987 Hailes' character caused a great deal of controversy after EastEnders screened the first male-to-male kiss on a UK, prime time soap. The kiss prompted a multitude of complaints from angry viewers and a hostile backlash from the right wing press. Despite the fact that Hailes is heterosexual, he suffered from severe homophobia because of the homosexual role he played in EastEnders. He was attacked several times by members of the public who couldn't separate fact from fiction, which included being assaulted in a supermarket by a disapproving woman and strangled by a man at a petrol station. Even after he left the show he lost a job as a children's television presenter because of the so-called \"gay tag\". Since leaving EastEnders in 1989, he has gone on to appear in films such as The Killing Zone (1999); Murder with Mirrors and Waiting for a Killer. On television he has appeared in ITV police drama The Bill (2001–02); Horizon; Nobody’s Hero; Sorry and the BBC’s production of Pinocchio. Theatre appearances include Strip Poker; Doctor on the Boil; Gollocks and numerous pantomimes. He has also performed several plays for BBC radio and voice-overs and had a regular slot \"Hailes Horrors\" on the Steve Allen show on LBC radio. As well as acting, Hailes also drives a London taxi."

She retired in 1958 following her marriage to playwright and actor Gerard McLarnon. She later earned a living as a teacher at the Central School of Music and Drama and the City University. After the death of her husband in 1997, a family friend lured her back on stage for a play he was producing. Although she had acted onstage in the 1940s/1950s, her first screen performance was in an episode of Doctors. She later appeared in The Bill, Doc Martin, Holby City, Hustle, Casualty, Ideal and Sensitive Skin, among other episodes. She guest starred as Christine in the episode \"From Out of the Rain\" in season 2 of the BBC spin-off show Torchwood. On film, she is best remembered for the role of Mrs. Connelly in Duplex. A widow, Essell died on 15 February 2015, aged 92. She is survived by her son, Fergus McLarnon."

  "text" : "(This is a Chinese name; the family name is Leung.) Edmond Leung Hon-man (born 5 November 1971) is a Hong Kong singer-songwriter, record producer, actor, and television host from Hong Kong. At age 17, Leung became a finalist in the eighth annual New Talent Singing Awards (新秀歌唱大賽) in 1989, which won him a contract with Capital Artists. He made his recording debut in 1990 with the release of Listen to the Edge (細聽鋒芒). He propelled to teen idol stardom in the mid-1990s and was famous for his rather feminine look, in which many of his songs portray the life of timid men dumped by their lovers. He was frozen by TVB for three months after he uttered profanity during a live broadcast of the Tung Wah Charity Show in 1995. In 2001, Capital Artists failed in the market, and Leung was left contract-less for over a year. During this time, Leung began composing music and was the leader of William So's concert band, while also learning to play the piano. Under the guidance of Paco Wong, he signed to Gold Typhoon in 2003, being marketed as a singer-songwriter. That same year, he released his first album under Gold Typhoon, Number 10, which won Best Album of the Year at the Ultimate Song Chart awards. Some of his hits include \"Thinking Too Much\" (自作聰明), \"Get Lost/Cheating\" (滾, duet with Miriam Yeung), \"Hey June\", \"Battleship Team\" (艦隊), \"8 Mile Highway\" (八里公路), \"Blooming Flowers in 3000 Years\" (三千年開花), \"Female News Presenter\" (新聞女郎), \"Beatles\" (披頭四), \"501\", \"Seven Friends\" (七友), \"Fresh Start\" (重新做人), \"Madam! Madam!\" (太太！太太！), \"Big Excitement\" (大激想, with Eason Chan and Miriam Yeung), \"Best Friend\" (好朋友), \"A Man in the Closet\" (衣櫃裡的男人), \"Three Wounded Hearts\" (傷了三個心), \"Love and Emotions\" (愛與情), \"Lingering Game\" (纏綿遊戲), and \"Don't Want To Be Alone\" (不願一個人). In 2008, he performed at the S.U.C.C.E.S.S. Charity Gala at Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada with many other artists. He was a co-host of the popular variety show, Beautiful Cooking with Ronald Cheng and Alex Fong."

A devotee of Bernard Shaw, she was president of the Shaw Society from 1949. In their obituary, the Independent wrote \"Pollock is believed to have played, in a career spanning 72 years, more Shavian heroines than anyone else. She directed London seasons of his plays; and it was during the London premiere of one of his lesser-known works – Farfetched Fables (Watergate, 1950) – that she announced Shaw's death from the stage.\" Pollock's dedication to acting began as a seven-year-old, when she saw Sarah Bernhardt on stage; she knew then that she wanted to be an actress herself. Pollock was also a theatre director and a teacher of drama at RADA and Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art; and her varied television work included several appearances in The Forsyte Saga for the BBC. She outlived both husbands, Captain Leslie Hancock and the artist James Proudfoot. She had one child with Captain Hancock. Pollock was the subject of TV's This Is Your Life in 1992. Ellen Pollock's mother, Hedwig Kahn, was the sister of Otto Hermann Kahn (wealthy investment banker, collector, philanthropist, and patron of the arts) and composer Robert Kahn."

He has been a fight choreographer for, amongst others, Jackie Chan, King Hu, and John Woo. Hung is one of the pivotal figures who spearheaded the Hong Kong New Wave movement of the 1980s, helped reinvent the martial arts genre and started the vampire-like jiangshi genre. He is widely credited with assisting many of his compatriots, giving them their starts in the Hong Kong film industry, by casting them in the films he produced, or giving them roles in the production crew. It is common for Asians to address their elders or influential people with familial nouns as a sign of familiarity and respect. Jackie Chan, for example, is often addressed as \"Da Goh\" (Chinese: 大哥; pinyin: dà gē), meaning Big Brother. Hung was also known as \"Dai Goh\", until the filming of Project A, which featured both actors. As Hung was the eldest of the kung fu \"brothers\", and the first to make a mark on the industry, he was given the nickname \"Da Goh Da\" (Chinese: 大哥大; pinyin: dà gē dà; Jyutping: daai6 go1 daai6), meaning, Big, Big Brother, or Biggest Big Brother."

His tenure as Burai was so popular and successful that when his character died in Zyuranger, a letter writing campaign was undertaken by fans of the series to have him brought back. While the writers ultimately decided to have Burai remain dead as a way of showing the younger viewers that even heroes die at times, Izumi returned to the role briefly as Burai's ghost toward the end of the series. He guest starred in Ninja Sentai Kakuranger and Chōriki Sentai Ohranger and appeared in the short Super Sentai World (as a photographer). He has retired from acting and has one son."

  "text" : "Sophie Bould is a British theatre and TV actress, from Shropshire, where she attended Thomas Telford School and St Dominic's High School for Girls in Brewood. She is now based in London. Her first stage appearance was as a little French girl, at age eight with the South Staffs Musical Theatre Company at the Grand Theatre in Wolverhampton. She has said: \"It was from that performance that I knew I wanted to be an actress, it propelled me to take drama lessons and now I’m returning to that stage. It’s a strange but lovely feeling\". Bould graduated with a first class degree from Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts, having earlier attended the National Youth Theatre. Her television appearances include Doctors, The Inspector Lynley Mysteries and Holby City. Bould appeared in the West End at the London Palladium in the original Andrew Lloyd Webber production of The Sound of Music, alongside Connie Fisher. Bould played the eldest child of the Von Trapp family, \"Liesl\". She was also the understudy for \"Maria\" and received rave reviews in that role, having stepped in to cover an extended absence by Fisher through illness. Bould left The Sound of Music on 24 September 2007. Bould appeared at the National Theatre on the South Bank in Coram Boy and enjoyed a season at Regents Park, London. Her stage debut was as the lead in the Rodgers and Hammerstein version of Cinderella, at the Bristol Old Vic. In 2008 she starred in the UK tour of Noises Off  and later that year as \"Belle\" at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre in A Christmas Carol until January 2010. During the summer of 2010, Bould joined the companies of Sheridan's The Critic and Tom Stoppard's The Real Inspector Hound at Chichester Festival Theatre, playing to full houses and rave reviews. Most recently she took the leading role of \"Lily\" in The Secret Garden at Edinburgh Festival Theatre and the Royal Alexandra Theatre, Toronto, Canada. She married Robin Savage in Shropshire in September 2010. Bould starred as \"Tracy Lord\" in a UK tour of High Society in early 2013."

Her other cinematic appearances include White Bird, Friend or Foe, and Terminal Game. The majority of her work came in the 1970s on British television when she appeared on Elizabeth R, Dead of Night, The Pallisers, In This House of Brede and Doctor Who in the story Underworld. She has since done mostly stage theatre, having performed in The Sentence, School For Sugar and The Scandal. After François Truffaut died in 1984, a director's cut of Two English Girls was released to great acclaim. In particular, the addition of several important scenes featuring Stacey was praised. This is the version currently available on DVD. Stacey died from breast cancer, having suffered from the illness for many years and been unable to work in TV, film or theatre as a result. She left behind her husband, Andy, and three children."

  "text" : "Strelsa Brown was an English film actress who was born in 1919 in Tientsin, China. Born as Edna Pearl Brown, her film career began with an uncredited part in The Ghosts of Berkeley Square in 1947. Her most noteworthy film credit is Quo Vadis. She played the role of Rufia in a film that earned numerous Academy Award nominations. Other films in which she appeared include Love I Haven't (1951), Sappho venere di Lesbo (1960), and Romanoff and Juliet (1961). Brown's true name is Edna Brown Muss. She was married to Henry Muss, an infantry soldier, who was a World War II hero. Muss was killed in action in 1945. In 1962, Brown claimed that she was owed between $2 and $3 million of a fortune begun by New York builder Isaac Muss, the father of Henry Muss. No will was left. Until then she had lived purely on her war pension from the US. She had given up acting on stage as a soubrette,due to her age,to look after her son David. The brothers and sisters of her husband, Henry Muss, just prior to 1962 had given her an ultimatum..sign that she agreed one of the wealthiest men in New York had left a total amount of $20.000 and they would continue to send $100 a month to her...(money they had started strangely to send just one year before at the time Isaac Muss had died) or else they would stop the monthly cheque. They stopped the monthly cheque and her son could not go to university. He was lucky enough to be put in contact with a wealthy friend of his grandmother who happened, like David, to be living in Italy. She. Mary Duyvendaak, gave David $80 a month so he could resume studies and continued this gift until he graduated in medicine in 1968. His mother never remarried and eventually committed suicide in 1976."

  "text" : "Samantha Holland (born 17 September 1969) is an English actress. She trained at The Guildhall School of Music and Drama (1988–91) where her year group included Daniel Craig Her work has covered a wide range in theatre, television, film and radio, but predominantly in theatre. From 2014 - 2015 her work has incorporated radio comedy, short film making and art installation. In 2014 DIS_CONNECT at the New Red Studios posed questions about how real our connection is with one another in a seemingly interconnected world. Have we become more disconnected? It involved red tape, umbrellas, briefcases, data collection, public information broadcasts and a bit of Cat Stevens. In 2013 She performed a new satire about the Pythia of Delphi at the Sir John Soane's Museum in London. She appeared in the BBC Radio comedy programme Hudson & Pepperdine Save the Planet as Marina, the fast talking manic depressive. Notable performances include Frankie in the Chichester Festival Theatre production of the Rodney Ackland play \"After October\" with Dorothy TutinTHEATRE: After October; Chichester Festival Theatre Paul Taylor. Ackland assembles a sizeable group of people whose hopes are hanging on Clive's play being a hit. These range from his sister, Joan (Maria Miles) - who, freed from dependency on her philistine of a lover, will be able to attend art school - to the depressive paying guest Frankie (an excellent Samantha Holland), who will be able to marry Clive and get rid of the well-meaning but boring Brian (Gregory Floy) with his stuffy old colonial slang (\"feeling pretty bobbish, thanks\") and his formulaic generosity. Tessa Bold in David Farr's play Max Klapper - A Life in Pictures at the Electric Cinema Her Edinburgh One Woman Show \"Am I Losing my Mind or Just my Figure\" was selected as part of the pick of the Edinburgh Festival Pleasance Fringe in 2001. The comedian and writer Nick Revell selected it as part of his pick of the week on BBC Radio Scotland, and it garnered four stars in The Scotsman."

  "text" : "Simon Lack (19 December 1913 – 8 August 1980) was a Scottish actor, working mostly in England. He was born Alexander MacAlpine, in Cleland, Lanarkshire, Scotland. Known locally as Alec, he was the youngest child and only son of his father, Alexander McAlpine (known as Sandy) and his mother Euphemia Ritchie. His sisters were Charlotte (Lottie), Mary, Euphemia (Euphie), Agnes (Nan) and Jenny. Another sister, Jessie, died in childhood. Sandy McAlpine was a stonemason, but worked down the mines when there was no masonry work available, making Simon Lack's later role in Proud Valley particularly poignant to those who knew him from his youth. Euphemia Ritchie's family were somewhat wealthier, but she was disowned on account of her choice of husband, and the family lived for many years in a one-room flat (known in Scottish working class language as a 'single end'), although it seems eventually one of her uncles relented and came to their aid. Alec's earliest ventures into acting were in local theatres. He seems to have chosen the pseudonym Simon Lack when he embarked upon the London stage. He lost five years during the Second World War (as did so many British actors). He served in the European theatre, and was present at Monte Cassino. After the war he returned to acting, getting back into stage work. He was also a member of the BBC Radio company during the late 1950s/early 1960s, and notably guest-starred in all but two of the Paul Temple serials (mysteries) that starred Peter Coke and Marjorie Westbury. His television roles included two Doctor Who serials; The Mind of Evil (1971) and The Androids of Tara (1978). He also guest-starred in episodes of The Saint, Jason King, and Doomwatch. He had co-starring roles in Telford's Change, Enemy at the Door and The Borgias."

  "text" : "Stig Gunnar Lasseby (March 5, 1925 – December 8, 1996) was a Swedish animator, director and producer. Through his company Team Film he played an important role in the history of Swedish animation. Lasseby was born in Gällivare and was educated as a teacher of drawing. In 1955, with two classmates, he founded the animation studio AB Team Film, which by 1966 made him one of Sweden's best known animators. In 1972 the company produced Agaton Sax och bröderna Max, a television series based on the book of the same name by Nils-Olof Franzén, one of the series about the detective Agaton Sax. In 1976 they produced a series of three short films for television about Agaton Sax, and also Agaton Sax and the Byköpings Village Festival, the first full-length entirely animated Swedish film, co-produced by the Swedish Film Institute. Team Film went on to produce two further full-length animated features, Peter-No-Tail (1981), which was a critical and popular success and was also released in several other countries, and Peter-No-Tail in Americat (1985), which had faster action and for which some of the animation and coloring was outsourced to Prague; it made less money and received a mixed critical reception. Team Film also produced a series for small children, Totte (1973), based on books by Gunilla Wolde, and three shorts based on other children's books, Kattresan (1982), Sjörövarfilmen (1983), and Musikbussen (1994), the first two again sponsored by the Swedish Film Institute. Lasseby also voiced Tänkande August, the computer, in the Agaton Sax films and TV series. Lasseby created an animation school in Eksjö; in 1996 this became the first college-level animation training program in Sweden. He died in 1996 in Hult."

  "text" : "Terry Scully (13 May 1932 – 17 April 2001) was a British theatre and television actor. After making his name in the theatre, from the 1960s onwards he became more known for TV work. In 1960 he starred in the BBC's production of An Age of Kings, playing King Henry VI in several episodes. Other notable roles for Scully were as Horatio Nelson in the 1968 television series, Triton, and as Bicket in the BBC's 1967 blockbuster adaptation of The Forsyte Saga. He also appeared in Dixon of Dock Green, Z-Cars, Softly, Softly, Callan, Public Eye, The Venturers, and Angels. Like many actors of his generation, he is now probably best remembered for his roles in Cult TV series, due to their enduring appeal - even though they were no more notable, at the time, than his many other TV roles. He appeared in the Doctor Who serial The Seeds of Death, the Blake's 7 episode \"Dawn of the Gods\" and starred as Vic Thatcher in four episodes of the 1970s series Survivors. During his time on that series, Scully suffered a nervous breakdown. As a result, his role was filled by actor Hugh Walters in subsequent episodes. In 2001 he died of a stroke, aged 68."

  "text" : "Keith Jayne (born 10 December 1960) is a British actor, known for playing the title role in the 1981 television adaptation Stig of the Dump. A slow growth rate, due to a pituitary gland problem, made Keith a target of bullies at grammar school. To escape them, he enrolled with The Barbara Speake Stage School. Early roles were in Rumpole of the Bailey, Angels and a variety of Children's Film Foundation productions, including Robin Hood Junior (1975), The Glitterball (1977) and Sammy's Super T-Shirt (1978).In 1974, Keith appeared as Wilfred Schoenfeld in an episode of Upstairs, Downstairs, entitled \"The Beastly Hun\". In 1975, he played Mick in Survivors. However, his big break happened in 1979 when he was cast as Tom Arnold, a cabin boy, in The Onedin Line. This was followed by the lead role in Thames Television’s, BAFTA award nominated, adaptation of Stig of The Dump - which 'is probably the part I am most remembered for'. Keith went on to play 'Boxer Reed' in all 54 episodes of Central TV's kid’s drama, Murphy's Mob. His appearance as Will Chandler - 'one of the most convincing and memorable companions The Doctor never had' – in Doctor Who serial The Awakening, led producer John Nathan-Turner to briefly consider making Keith a series regular. Typecasting (often as a yokel) persuaded Keith to study for a certificate in Finance and Investment. This coincided with a dark period his life, when his earlier health problems came back to haunt him. 'As a result of the growth hormone treatment I received as a child, I received a letter from the NHS saying I may have contracted CJD.' Keith’s high profile saw him interviewed on ITN, a broadcast that curtailed his acting career. 'The fact that it was reported that I was dying did not help me get any further work as no casting director is going to employ you if there is a chance you will keel over before episode two.' Having run a financial services business for the last 22 years, Keith is planning on a return to acting. Looking for an agent he has already made a brief return to television, as a guest in the 'Blast From The Past' section of The Justin Lee Collins Show."

Faulkner started his career at Corona Academy at the age of eleven and moved on to an adult career in film and television in the late 1950s and early 1960s before leaving the \"business\" and moving to Australia, with the telecommunications company he then worked with, along with his wife Pat and two sons Lee and Simon. In the late 1940s, he appeared at the London Coliseum in Annie Get Your Gun playing Annie Oakley's brother Little Jake. In 1951, he appeared at Stratford-upon-Avon's Memorial Theatre during the Festival of Britain Season, playing Falstaff's Page in Henry IV and the Boy in Henry V. This was followed by an extensive tour of Britain with the Elizabethen Theatre Company, performing various Shakespearean productions. In the 1950s, Keith Faulkner was known for his roles as Ginger in Just William and Bob Cherry in Billy Bunter of Greyfriars School (both BBC TV series) and also featured in juvenile roles in a number of feature films. In the early 1960s, he appeared in several B-film thrillers and crime films and starred in The Man in the Back Seat, and Strongroom. His last screen credit was in 1963."

  "text" : "(This is a Chinese name; the family name is Lee.) Lee Jun-fan (Chinese: 李振藩; November 27, 1940 – July 20, 1973), known professionally as Bruce Lee, was a Hong Kong and American actor, martial artist, philosopher, filmmaker, and founder of the martial art Jeet Kune Do. Lee was the son of Cantonese opera star Lee Hoi-Chuen. He is widely considered by commentators, critics, media, and other martial artists to be one of the most influential martial artists of all time, and a pop culture icon of the 20th century. He is often credited with helping to change the way Asians were presented in American films. Lee was born in Chinatown, San Francisco on November 27, 1940 to parents from Hong Kong and was raised in Kowloon, Hong Kong with his family until his late teens. He was introduced to the film industry by his father and appeared in several films as a child actor. Lee moved to the United States at the age of 18 to receive his higher education, at the University of Washington, at Seattle and it was during this time that he began teaching martial arts. His Hong Kong and Hollywood-produced films elevated the traditional Hong Kong martial arts film to a new level of popularity and acclaim, sparking a surge of interest in Chinese martial arts in the West in the 1970s. The direction and tone of his films changed and influenced martial arts and martial arts films in the US, Hong Kong and the rest of the world. He is noted for his roles in five feature-length films: Lo Wei's The Big Boss (1971) and Fist of Fury (1972); Golden Harvest's Way of the Dragon (1972), directed and written by Lee; Golden Harvest and Warner Brothers' Enter the Dragon (1973) and The Game of Death (1978), both directed by Robert Clouse. Lee became an iconic figure known throughout the world, particularly among the Chinese, as he portrayed Chinese nationalism in his films. He trained in the art of Wing Chun and later combined his other influences from various sources, in the spirit of his personal martial arts philosophy, which he dubbed Jeet Kune Do (The Way of the Intercepting Fist). Lee held dual nationality of Hong Kong and the US. He died in Kowloon Tong on July 20, 1973 at the age of 32."

After attracting attention for her roles in Russ Meyer's films, Babette Bardot began touring the United States in 1968 as a burlesque dancer under the guidance of her husband and manager, Bob Baker. With the seductive coif of platinum blonde hair and the billing caption \"44-24-38 World's Most Sensational Exotic Entertainer\" her appearances included the Gayety Theatre in New York, the Town Theatre in Chicago and the Colony Club in Dallas. While covering the burlesque circuit, she became a frequent guest on TV and radio programs, including the Wally Phillips Show (WGN-Chicago), The Steve Allen Show and The Phil Donahue Show. She toured in a number of countries, and later found a home at the Majestic Inn (on MacLeod Trail and 50th Ave South) in Calgary, Alberta. The liberal stripping laws in Alberta allowed her to fully strip; however Babette would only remove her tops while retaining a thong. She was the headliner for the hotel bar, the Majic Stik, opening during the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede to a packed house nightly for six months before departing for Las Vegas. Although unconfirmed, Babette claimed that she was a distant relative of Brigitte Bardot and had once modeled for Pablo Picasso while in her late teens. During the Vietnam War, her popularity and public notoriety resulted in a photo insertion in the GI newspaper Stars and Stripes."

In 1911, the family lived in Salford, Lancashire. She appeared as Maggie Hobson in the David Lean film version of Hobson's Choice (1954) with John Mills and Charles Laughton, set in Salford. Laughton allegedly didn't like de Banzie because she wasn't getting 'her part right'. De Banzie was also upstaging Laughton who was, by all accounts, a notorious upstager himself. Her most notable film role was as Phoebe Rice, the hapless wife of comedian Archie Rice (played by Laurence Olivier), in the 1960 film version of John Osborne's The Entertainer. She had also appeared on Broadway in the original play, for which she received a Tony Award nomination. Other memorable film roles included The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956), directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and The Pink Panther (1963), directed by Blake Edwards. She died at the age of 71 due to complications following brain surgery."

This included a two-person production with Sladen in Mooney and his Caravans. A notable TV appearance was Miller playing the husband of Sladen in the ITV drama Send In The Girls. Miller and their daughter, Sadie Miller, performed with Sladen in a number of Sarah Jane Smith audio plays, released by Big Finish Productions.

In a career spanning five decades, Gosney played roles in Up Pompeii, Last of the Summer Wine, Believe Nothing, Time Gentlemen Please, Keeping Up Appearances and Harry Hill. He is perhaps best remembered for his performances in Harry Hill's show in which he filled the role of an absurd type of continuity announcer and the character Ken Ford (\"the man from 'The Joy Of Sex' books...\").He would often send himself up and perform surreal impressions of various celebrities, including Barbra Streisand, Joan Collins & Cliff Richard. He died on 24 January 2008 after complications resulting from a fall. An episode of Al Murray's Happy Hour broadcast on ITV1 on 15 February 2008 was dedicated to him."

She turned it down and the part was given to Prunella Scales. She played a radical English teacher, Judy Threadgold, opposite Alun Armstrong’s woodwork teacher in Alan Plater’s Get Lost! for Yorkshire Television, shown in 1981. Armstrong was unavailable for a sequel, so it was completely recast and became The Beiderbecke Affair with the parts going to Barbara Flynn and James Bolam. Turner died on 27 December 2014 in Dorchester at the age of 75, and was survived by her husband, Frank Cox. She was also godmother to actor Tom Burke."

  "text" : "Ben Holden Driver Warriss (29 May 1909 – 14 January 1993), known as Ben Warriss, was an English comedian and the first cousin of fellow comedy actor Jimmy Jewel. Allegedly the two cousins were born in the same bed (at different times) and brought up in the same household at 52 Andover Street, Sheffield. He was the son of Benjamin Holden Joseph Warriss, an insurance company inspector, and his wife, Mary Ann, née Driver, Jewel's mother's sister. He first performed on the stage in 1930. Jimmy Jewel and Ben Warriss came together as professionals in 1934 at the Palace Theatre, Newcastle. Their double act achieved seven Royal Variety Performances, 12 Blackpool summer seasons, a successful radio series (Up the Pole) and a film of the series. Around 1966, the two went their separate ways, with Warriss performing on stage and Jewel moving into television. In the 1970s Warriss was the resident compere at the Cala Gran club in Fleetwood, Lancashire. In 1988 he played the Emperor of China in the first of the newly reopened Hackney Empire pantomimes, Aladdin. He was still performing in pantomime in his eighties. The character Parker from the 1960s TV series of Thunderbirds is said to have been based upon Warriss' appearance. His first wife, whom he married on 22 September 1934, was Grace Mary Skinner (b. 1910-11), a dancer and teacher of dancing and daughter of Henry Arthur James Skinner, master mariner. This marriage had ended by about 1940 and two years later Warriss married the entertainer Meggie Easton. His third marriage, which took place about 1960, was to Virginia Vernon. He died in 1993 at Brinsworth House, Staines Road, Twickenham, and is buried in the same section of Streatham Park Cemetery, London, as comedian Will Hay."

He was most prominently seen in light comedic roles in the British cinema of the 1930s and is perhaps best known as Jessie Matthews' leading man in Evergreen (1934), Gangway (1937) and Sailing Along (1938). Other notable roles include Lieutenant Somerville in Brown on Resolution (1935) and as Fred, Scrooge's nephew, in MGM's film A Christmas Carol (1938), the latter being one of two films he made in the US; the other was the lead role in a B-picture, Smuggled Cargo (1939). After these films there was a long gap in his film career until he reappeared as a character actor in the 1950s, making his last film (Timeslip) in 1955. Barry also appeared in the 1954 Sheldon Reynolds produced Sherlock Holmes television series. He portrayed Reggie \"Sardines\" Taunton in episode 17; \"The Case of the Laughing Mummy\"."

  "text" : "William James Hung (born January 13, 1983), also known as Hung Hing Cheong, is a Hong Kong-born American former singer who gained fame in early 2004 as a result of his off-key audition performance of Ricky Martin's hit song \"She Bangs\" on the third season of the television series American Idol. At the time of his audition, Hung was a civil engineering student at UC Berkeley. After his spirited audition to be the next American Idol, he inadvertently won the support of many fans. Hung voluntarily left university to pursue a music career. His recording career was marked by constant negative critical reaction, and his fame became the subject of much controversy as both he and his fans were accused of promoting and endorsing racial stereotypes against Asians, as he was perceived to lack musical talent and be celebrated only for embodying these stereotypes. In spite of the criticism and the implications of his success, he only showed signs of thoroughly enjoying his celebrity, believing he was living his dream. He brought his own career as a musician to an end when in 2011 he accepted a job opportunity as a technical crime analyst for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, and decided to pursue law enforcement instead of music. Since then, Hung has reflected positively on his pop music career."

  "text" : "Will Adamsdale (born 1974) is an English actor, comedian and writer. Adamsdale was educated at Eton College and the Oxford School of Drama. In 2004, he starred in a self-penned one man show called Jackson's Way at the Edinburgh Fringe. The intended run for the production was ten days, before the intervention of comedian Stewart Lee. Lee was so impressed by Adamsdale's work that he reportedly threw his full support behind Jackson's Way, lobbying for an extension of the run and using his clout within the industry to garner notice from critics and award committees. Adamsdale secured the Perrier Comedy Award for comedy. Adamsdale has since created several new shows: The Receipt, The Human Computer, and The Summer House. The Receipt, a collaboration with sonic artist Chris Branch, used innovative sound effects to punctuate a story about the little man in the big city. It ran at the Edinburgh Fringe 2006, winning a Fringe First and a Total Theatre Award. It subsequently toured nationally, and internationally to the Melbourne Comedy Festival and 59E59 Theatres in New York. In The Human Computer, Adamsdale, a self-confessed technophobe, explored the world of computers. The show premiered in the new Traverse 3 venue at the Edinburgh Fringe 2007. He made his film acting debut in The Boat That Rocked as Newsreader John, in 2009. He is now a regular cast member of the Channel 4 2011 series Campus, playing Jason the University accountant."

She made her television debut in 1994, and has acted in dramas such as Masters of the Sea (1994) and Rising Expectations (长河) (1997). She became a household name for her lead role as Inspector Elaine Tay in MediaCorp's Channel 5 cop drama Triple Nine (Season 1 and 2) from 1995 to 1997. After a brief hiatus from acting in 1999, she returned in 2001 and started acting frequently in Channel 8 dramas such as Love Me, Love Me Not (真爱无敌) (2001), The Challenge (谁与争锋) (2001) and The Reunion (顶天立地) (2001). She was also one of the four judges of the reality TV series \"The Dance Floor\". In 2008, Li-Lin starred in the Singapore romance film The Leap Years alongside Ananda Everingham, and was nominated for Best Performer in the Singapore Film Awards 2009. The movie was directed by Jean Yeo. Li-Lin was educated at Haig Girls’ School and Temasek Secondary School, before winning a scholarship to study ballet at the Royal Ballet School in London, where she became Head Girl. During her time off from showbiz, she subsequently obtained her Master’s degree in Anthropology at University of Surrey, where she wrote her dissertation on Falun Gong, and graduated in 2001. Li-Lin is well known for her straightforward personality. Her passion for dance, movement and fitness led to pioneering Singapore’s Pilates movement, and to founding several local dance centers.

This became a pattern, in that he was cast as the villain in the majority of his movies, with Martial Club being a famous exception. In 1985, Wang moved behind the camera, choreographing fight scenes, writing, and directing many movies such as Hong Kong Godfather. He has recently retired from the industry."

  "text" : "Olga Kosakiewicz (Ukrainian: Ольга Козакевич; 6 November 1915 – 1983) was a student of Simone de Beauvoir who joined the circle of de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre in 1935, aged 19. She and her sister, Wanda, were fused together to make one central character in de Beauvoir's first novel L'Invitée (She Came to Stay, 1943), which was dedicated to Olga (where her name appears as Kosakievicz in the Norton translation). The Kiev-born Olga, along with Bianca Lamblin and Natalie Sorokin, later stated that their \"trio\" relationships with Sartre and de Beauvoir damaged them psychologically. In Sartre's trilogy of novels, Les Chemins de la Liberté (The Roads to Freedom), the character of Ivich is considered a representation of Olga. Deirdre Bair's biography of Simone de Beauvoir examines this relationship. Hazel Rowley also discusses it at length in her book about the relationship between Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre. Olga married Jacques-Laurent Bost, a long-time lover of de Beauvoir. She died of tuberculosis in 1983."

Zhang is best known for her appearances in Rush Hour 2 (2001), Hero (2002), House of Flying Daggers (2004), 2046 (2004) and The Banquet (2006). Her most critically acclaimed works are Memoirs of a Geisha (2005), which earned her a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama, the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role; and The Grandmaster (2013), for which she won 12 different Best Actress awards to become the most awarded Chinese actress for a single film.

He is counted amongst the Fifth Generation of Chinese filmmakers, having made his directorial debut in 1987 with Red Sorghum. Zhang has won numerous awards and recognitions, with Best Foreign Film nominations for Ju Dou in 1990, Raise the Red Lantern in 1991, and Hero in 2003, Silver Lion and Golden Lion prizes at the Venice Film Festival, Grand Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, and the Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival. In 1993, he was a member of the jury at the 43rd Berlin International Film Festival. Zhang directed the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympic Games, which received considerable international acclaim. One of Zhang's recurrent themes is the resilience of Chinese people in the face of hardship and adversity, a theme which has been explored in such films as, for example, To Live (1994) and Not One Less (1999). His films are particularly noted for their rich use of colour, as can be seen in some of his early films, like Raise the Red Lantern, and in his wuxia films like Hero and House of Flying Daggers. His most recent film is a historical drama film called Coming Home."

He is considered \"one of the founding fathers of Cantopop\" by \"combining a hugely successful film and music career.\" He rose to prominence as a teen heartthrob and pop icon of Hong Kong in the 1980s, receiving numerous music awards including both Most Popular Male Artist Awards at the 1988 and 1989 Jade Solid Gold Best Ten Music Awards. In 1989, Cheung announced his retirement from the music industry as a pop singer. Returning to the music scene after a five-year hiatus, Cheung released his chart-topping comeback album Most Beloved (寵愛) which achieved a huge market success. In 1999, he won the Golden Needle Award for his outstanding achievement as a musician at the RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards, and his 1984 hit song Monica was voted as Hong Kong's \"Song of the Century\". He was honoured as \"Asia's Biggest Superstar\" at the 2000 CCTV-MTV Music Honours. Cheung won the 1991 Hong Kong Film Award (Days of Being Wild) and the 1994 Hong Kong Film Critics Society Award (Ashes of Time) for best actor. He had also won the 1994 Japan Film Critics Society Award for best actor for his performance in Farewell My Concubine and ten other best actor nominations, five Golden Horse Awards, three Cannes Film Festival Awards, a Asia Pacific Film Festival Award, and a Venice Film Festival Award. Cheung's music and movies not only captured fans in Hong Kong but also other Asian areas including Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, China, Japan and South Korea. He is the first foreign artist to hold 16 concerts in Japan that has yet to be broken and the record holder as the best-selling C-pop artist in Korea. Cheung was ranked as the favourite actor in the 100 years of Chinese cinema. In 2010, he was voted the third \"Most Iconic Musicians of All Time\" (after Michael Jackson and The Beatles). CNN considered Cheung as the \"Most Beautiful Man from Hong Kong Cinema\" and one of \"Asia's 25 Greatest Actors of All Time.\" Cheung committed suicide on April 1, 2003 by jumping off the 24th floor of the Mandarin Oriental hotel in Hong Kong. A suicide note left by Cheung stated that he had been suffering from depression."

  "text" : "Hubert Gregg (14 July 1914 – 30 March 2004) was a BBC broadcaster, writer and stage actor. At the end of his life he was probably best known for the BBC Radio 2 \"oldies\" shows A Square Deal and Thanks for the Memory. In an earlier era he had also been a novelist, a theatre director and a hit songwriter. Born in Islington, London, he worked for the BBC from the 1930s onwards, wrote the wartime hit \"I'm Going To Get Lit Up When The Lights Go up in London\" in 1943, and on seeing the German doodlebugs flying over London, composed the song \"Maybe It's Because I'm A Londoner\", which became a hit and London folk anthem in 1947. Gregg spoke German fluently, and during the war worked for the BBC German service, to such good effect that Goebbels assumed he must be a German traitor. He was married three times: his first wife was musical comedy star Zoe Gail, with whom he had a daughter, actress-writer Stacey Gregg; his second wife was the actress and singer Pat Kirkwood; and finally in 1980 he married Carmel Lytton with whom he had two more children."

These have been re-issued as e-books in 2016. Ten years after Carvic's death, his books were re-issued in the U.S.A. and proved sufficiently popular for his Estate to commission further Miss Seeton stories from two other writers using pseudonyms with \"HC\" initials. Roy Peter Martin as \"Hampton Charles\" wrote three novels, which were all released in 1990. Sarah J. Mason, writing as \"Hamilton Crane\", then took up the series writing 14 books in all."

She married MacNeice in 1942; the couple had one daughter. They separated in 1960. Among the composers and lyricists who wrote songs for her were Auden, MacNeice, Benjamin Britten, Elisabeth Lutyens and William Alwyn. Auden's \"Funeral Blues\" (also known as \"Stop all the clocks\", later to become famous through its use in the film Four Weddings and a Funeral) was originally written for Anderson and set to music by Britten as part of Auden and Isherwood's play The Ascent of F6 (1936), then revised by Auden as a separate poem. In later years she owned, and cooked in, the Spinnaker restaurant in Scilly, Kinsale, County Cork, which specialised in seafood and Mediterranean and North African food."

Taylor's first London appearance was in 1830 as Nina, in William Dimond's Carnival of Naples. Her Rosalind, Aspatia (to Macready's Melantius) in The Bridal, and Lady Teazle to the Charles Surface of Walter Lacy (whom she was married in 1839) confirmed her position and popularity. She was the original Helen in The Hunchback (1832), and also created Nell Gwynne in Douglas William Jerrold's play of that name, and the heroine in his Housekeeper. She was considered the leading Ophelia of her day. She retired in 1848."

He was four years old when picked for the part, which required him to have his blond hair dyed dark brown. In an interview with AMC, director Richard Donner said Stephens got the part after attacking the filmmaker (at Donner's urging), punching Donner in the testicles for good measure. It was the only major film role in Stephens' career; he would later play a small role in the 1980 TV film Gauguin the Savage. He also appears in the DVD special features section of the 2006 version of The Omen, and appears as a tabloid journalist in the film. Interview footage of Stephens from 1996 was used in the 2005 documentary The Curse of the Omen, a program detailing the supposed eerie coincidences surrounding the making of the film. Stephens appeared on The Howard Stern Show on Sirius Radio on 23 April 2008 to promote a film he was working on. He said he also has started appearing at autograph signings and horror conventions \"with my tricycle.\""

Huang's performances in her most recent drama serials, Three Wishes and Tiger Mum, garnered largely favourable responses and proved to be hugely popular among viewers. Both dramas hold the title of Top Rated Drama for Years 2014 and 2015 respectively. As a freelance actress without an artiste management contract with the TV station, Huang has been disqualified from contesting in the annual Star Awards in recent years. This has drawn much controversy from the public."

  "text" : "Hsiao Ho, (Hsiao Hou) (Chinese: 小侯; Cantonese: Siu Hau, born 1 January 1958 in Meixian District, Guangdong, China) is a Hong Kong martial arts film actor, stunt performer and action choreographer. A Hakka, he has acted in many films directed by Lau Kar-leung, including Mad Monkey Kung Fu and Legendary Weapons of China. In 1985 he portrayed legendary kung fu warrior Fong Sai-Yuk in the Lau directed action-comedy, Disciples of the 36th Chamber and also took a lead role in Fake Ghost Catchers, directed by Lau Kar Wing. Fake Ghost Catchers is marketed by Celestial Pictures as being made two years before Ghostbusters (inferring that the idea for Ghostbusters may have come from the movie). Hou is also known for portraying the \"disfigured swordsman\" and doubling complicated action scenes in 1993's Iron Monkey. He was also the action director for the movie Shaolin Avengers (1994). In 1982 he was nominated for Best Action Choreography for the movie Legendary Weapons of China (for which he was action director) at the Hong Kong Film Awards alongside Lau Kar Leung and Ching Chu who also provided choreography for the film. Born Hao Yiu Chung, he was trained in Beijing opera by Fan Kuk-Fa as a child and acted in films. He moved to the United States in the 1960s with classmates where he learned acrobatics from different instructors under the watchful tutelage of Fan Kuk-Fa. He later returned to China, and at age 17 became a martial arts stunt performer, which led to his starring role in Mad Monkey Kung Fu in 1979. He then became a contracted actor with Shaw Brothers Studio and studied Hung Gar, a specialised Kung Fu under Lau Kar Leung. A very young man at the time, he was always cast by director Lau Kar Leung as the rebellious teen. In the cult classic My Young Auntie Hou played the energetic rebellious teenage son of Lau Kar Leung. In Disciples of the 36th Chamber he also played the rebellious son. Because of an ability to perform difficult stunts and acrobats with ease, Hsiao Hou was often cast in roles that required an expert stunt performer and martial artist. While his career did not reach the popularity of frequent co-stars Gordon Liu or Kara Hui, he is considered a Shaw Brothers legend by legions of fans and is highly regarded for martial arts, comedic talents, and acrobatic talent. Lau Kar Leung was once quoted as calling Hou the most \"talented action actor (or star)\" in his class. Hsiao Hou's last known interview was in 2004 taken by Video Asia. Though he was not featured on the cover in western versions of the popular Shaw Brother releases, Hsiao Hou took the starring roles in Mad Monkey Kung Fu, Legendary Weapons of China, Disciples of the 36th Chamber, Fake Ghost Catchers and My Young Auntie. He later acted in small supporting roles in films by Sammo Hung. He has also been a martial arts and action director/choreographer."

He was educated at Charterhouse School and a graduate of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. His first marriage was to the actress Valerie Taylor. In his book The Stage Struck Me! fellow actor Neville Phillips felt Sinclair always played variations of himself, handsome, debonair, suave and witty and excelled in light comedy. By contrast Phillips felt his wife, who Sinclair often appeared opposite, was a dramatic actress of tremendous power with a magnificent voice. Sinclair appeared both on Broadway and on the West End. His screen work began in British films. His most notable role possibly is Leslie Charteris' The Saint in The Saint's Vacation followed by The Saint Meets the Tiger. Sinclair died in Slapton, England at the age of 59."

During her prime years, Mui made major contributions to the Cantopop music scene while receiving numerous awards and honours. She remained an idol throughout most of her career, and was generally regarded as a Cantopop diva. Mui once held a sold-out concert in Hammersmith, London, England, where she was dubbed the \"Madonna of Asia (東方麥當娜)\", which brought her to further international fame. That title stayed with her throughout her career, and has been used as a comparison for both Eastern and Western media. In the 1980s, the gangtai style of music was revolutionised by Mui's wild dancing and on-stage femininity. She was famed for her outrageous costumes and high-power performances in combination with contralto vocals, which are rare in female artists. Her fan base reached far beyond Hong Kong into many parts of Asia, including Taiwan, mainland China, Singapore and Malaysia, and other countries as well. In the Hong Kong entertainment industry, where stars often rise and fall quickly, Mui remained in the spotlight for 21 years (1982–2003). Her career came to a halt abruptly in 2003 when she announced that she had cervical cancer. She died later that year at the age of 40. Mui's continuing commemoration by the Hong Kong entertainment industry was due not only to her music and film legacies, but also her involvement in charity and humanitarian work."

  "text" : "Antonia de Sancha (born 14 September 1961 in Hammersmith, London) is an English actress and businesswoman best known as the former mistress of British Conservative Member of Parliament and Cabinet minister David Mellor which became public knowledge in 1992. She is the daughter of a Spanish film producer father, who died in the mid-1980s, and a Swedish mother who, suffering from severe depression, committed suicide 18 months later, shortly before her daughter began studies at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. At the time of the revelations of her affair, de Sancha was described by some news outlets as a \"soft-porn actress\" because she had played the part of a prostitute in a film in which she had simulated sex. The film \"The Pieman\" also featured John Hemming-Clark, leader of political party Independents to Save Queen Mary's Hospital, as de Sancha's husband. Although \"The Pieman\" has never been on general release, an account of the plot can be found in Hemming-Clark's book, In You Go! A year or two in the life of a scout leader. The affair with Mellor was a contributory factor in his subsequent resignation from the cabinet on 24 September 1992. Believing her acting career was ruined and aware that newspapers were making money out of the story and she wasn't, de Sancha hired publicist Max Clifford to sell her story to various newspapers. She made about £30,000 from those sales. The furore that followed publication left her deeply unhappy. \"It was emotional rape\", de Sancha told an interviewer ten years after the scandal referring to the bugging of her flat which led to the affair being made public. She has had scarcely any work as an actress since the scandal, and considers the scandal as the reason a subsequent marriage failed. She was the subject of an instalment of the Discovery Channel documentary series The Mistress in 2002. De Sancha now runs an Indian textiles importing business in Portobello Road, Kensington, west London."

He exhibits regularly in Mayfair, London and Dublin, Ireland Murphy was a child-actor, his roles including the eponymous hero in the British television serial, Tom Brown's Schooldays (1971), which won Emmys for Murphy as 'Best Lead Actor in a Miniseries' for his role as Tom Brown and as 'Best Miniseries' after it was screened by PBS in 1973. Despite the critical acclaim, he never again worked as an actor. Murphy attended New College at Oxford University from 1970-1975 to study Philosophy, Psychology and Physiology. He then married his first wife and moved to Ireland, working as a potter and an aerial photographer. But after four years Murphy divorced, and subsequently he returned to school to study law. Despite lacking passion for the law, Murphy pursued a career as a corporate lawyer, first in England then in Paris, France. In Paris he met and married his second wife. Murphy began to paint “to relieve the boredom of corporate law.” Murphy’s first painting exhibition in 1991 in London was a great success, and his colorful Gauguin-esque paintings became highly desirable. In 1992, Murphy and his new wife relocated from Paris to a large country house near Carcassonne in the south of France. He continues to paint and exhibit work, but he rarely leaves the Languedoc."

As a politician Denville was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Newcastle upon Tyne Central seat from Sir Charles Trevelyan in the 1931 general election and held the seat until he was defeated in 1945. For a time he was associated with the far right of the Conservative Party, and during the 1930s was a leading member of the Friends of National Spain, which stressed support for Francisco Franco and anti-communism. He had also declared himself to be an admirer of Benito Mussolini although, in keeping with a number of contemporary Tories who admired the southern European fascists, he was critical of Adolf Hitler."

  "text" : "Audrey Fildes (24 November 1922, Bromborough, Cheshire, UK; 13 September 1997, Toronto, Canada was a British actress whose first film credit was the 1947 production While I Live. In 1949, she played the role of Louis Mazzini's mother, who was ostracised by her aristocratic family, in the film Kind Hearts and Coronets. Granddaughter of Victorian painter, Sir Luke Fildes R.A. and Welsh Sculptor Sir William Goscombe-John R.A., and son of British Olympian (Epée) Luke Val Fildes, Audrey showed keen interest in acting while a student at Hayes Court School. She later related that, while at Hayes Court, she was directed in a performance of The Merchant of Venice by Alec Guinness. At the performance, he brought Peggy Ashcroft backstage and introduced Audrey to her as \"my Portia\". During her 20s she enjoyed an active acting career, appearing as Sonia in the celebrated production of Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment with John Gielgud at the New Theatre in 1946 and as Diana in Jean Anouilh's Ring Round the Moon (1950), directed by Peter Brook and costarring Paul Scofield. She married a Canadian Design Consultant in 1955, and moved to Ottawa. They had two sons Paul and Nicholas before separating, following which Audrey returned to England to raise her sons. In the early Seventies Audrey trained for a second career as a Gilder and Restorer at the City and Guilds of London School. In 1976 she returned to Canada, settling in Toronto. Her gilding and restoration clients included the Government of Ontario and pieces of her work remain at Queen's Park, the Provincial Parliament. She was a member of the William Morris Society of Canada."

(The producers had said in an interview that they had promised Bugeja a role after she stood in for someone at a read-through, but were forced to give her only a small part as Respectable was taking up most of her time.) She appeared in over two dozen British TV commercials, notably the award-winning campaign for Sure antiperspirant with the punchline \"Thank god you dumped him first!\", and a hugely successful campaign for Yakult yoghurt drink. She had guest roles in The Bill once in 2005, where she appeared as the girlfriend of a man who was holding his dad and three officers hostage at St Hugh's and the second time in 2007 when she appeared in three episodes as Nina Lloyd, the ex partner of CPS solicitor Matt Hinkley who had driven her to a mental breakdown.

Chen was educated at the now defunct Serangoon Garden Secondary Technical School. He joined the SBC after completing the 5th artiste drama training class and made his debut in 1984. He holds a black belt in taekwondo and his martial arts background led him to being cast in many wuxia dramas in the 1990s and as characters with fight scenes in other drama series. He is also a member of the Singapore Celebrity Soccer Team. The Straits Times remarked that Chen's \"much-praised understated turn\" in the Cannes Film Festival award-winning Ilo Ilo put him in the spotlight once again. Chen hit the headlines again when two parody music videos he starred in, went viral. The first, titled \"Unbelievable\", was 'lauded' for the nonsensical line 'I so stunned like vegetable' (sic), drawing the attention of TIME, while the second, \"Sandcastle in My Heart\", in which Irene Ang also starred in, did not become as popular as the previous one. Both videos are a parody of popular Chinese MVs in the 1970s, particularly the work of Singaporean singer Huang Ching Yuan."

Dixon's most notable role was in the 1981 BBC TV series The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, in which he starred as Ford Prefect. He also received critical acclaim for his portrayal of Ariel in the 1980 BBC version of The Tempest (directed by John Gorrie). He would later rejoin the Hitchhiker's Guide by lending his voice to the \"Ecological Man\" and the \"Zirzla Leader\" in Fit the Twentieth of the radio series, while Geoffrey McGivern, who had originally played the character on radio, returned to the role of Ford. Despite a relatively sparse TV and film career, David Dixon has over the years acquired a loyal fan following online who call themselves \"Dixonites\"."

After training at the Glasgow College of Dramatic Art, Coffey began a career in repertory at the Gateway Theatre in Edinburgh, then moved to the Palladium Theatre there. She later worked for the BBC as a radio interviewer, before appearing in London's West End. In the 1970s she was a member of director Frank Dunlop's repertory company in London's Young Vic Theatre, appearing in several productions and beginning her career as a playwright with some children's shows. Coffey has had a few supporting film roles. These have included Sidonia in Waltz of the Toreadors (1962), Peg in Georgy Girl (1966), Soberness in Far from the Madding Crowd (1967), and Mrs. E in Vivian Stanshall's Sir Henry at Rawlinson End (1980). Her television appearances include Do Not Adjust Your Set, the Stanley Baxter series (1968, 1971), Girls About Town (1970–71), Hold the Front Page (1974; which she also created), and End of Part One (1979). She always refused to appear in commercials declaring that it was reprehensible to try to persuade people to buy things they didn't need. On radio, Coffey featured in The Wordsmiths at Gorsemere, in the first series of The Burkiss Way and in The Next Programme Follows Almost Immediately and has made guest appearances on several programmes, including I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue and Just a Minute. She starred with Miriam Margolyes in two series of Alison and Maud (2002-4). She was also a regular panelist on The Law Game. She has also enjoyed success as a theatre director, including several notable productions at the Shaw Festival in Canada, such as Noël Coward's Private Lives and Shaw's Androcles and the Lion and Pygmalion. She lives in Devon where she has a successful career as an artist."

  "text" : "(This is a Chinese name; the family name is Wong.) Dayo Wong Tze-wah (born 5 September 1960) is a Hong Kong stand-up comedian, actor, presenter, screenwriter, and singer, who is the pioneer of stand-up comedy in Hong Kong. Wong gained a degree in philosophy from the University of Alberta in Canada. He began his career in the entertainment industry in Hong Kong in 1984, but he is best known for his works in live stand-up comedy which he started performing regularly since 1990. Since then he has starred in TV dramas and films, and recorded his own album. Dayo had his TVB TV series debut in 1999, acting as \"Lai Sam\" in \"Justice Sung 2\". A year later, he reached a milestone of his TV series career. Dayo as a lazy office assistant in a law firm in War of the Gender, winning the My Favourite Television Character Award in 2002. It is when his flame reached his highest point. 2004 was a fruitful year for Dayo as it was when he won two awards: the My Favourite On-Screen Partners (with Ada Choi in \"Catch the Uncatchable\") and again, the My Favourite Television Character Award (also in \"Catch the Uncatchable\"). He was so close to the \"TV King\" Award (The Best Actor Award). He was on the nomination list of the award in both 2007 and 2009. He was finally crowned as TV King with \"Bounty Lady\" in 2013. To Dayo, the award was an accumulative result of his TVB dramas. He also revealed that his relationship with Chilam were like cousins. In that year, Chilam Cheung started as the clear favourite of the audience due to his absolute popularity starring as Captain Cool in \"Triumph in the Skies 2\". Though Chilam ended up winning the Most Popular Male Character, he sounded disappointed in his acceptance speech (the price is widely recognised as a consolation prize to The Best Actor Award). Chilam did not stay behind the ceremony for the TVB official interview. He explained that he was not informed to stay behind for any interview. The discord rumours between Chilam and Dayo begin to spread out widely. However, the rumour was shot down when Chilam surprised Dayo by his sudden appearance at a meal gathering of the Bounty Lady. Besides the TVB drama career, Dayo is also well known to be a stand-up comedian. He introduced stand up comedy to Hong Kong. He has done thirteen stand up comedy routines so far, mainly targeting local Hong Kongnese. Unlike Northern American stand-up comedians, his jokes usually includes a lot of political and philosophical content, which brings up a high level of consonant among audience. \"Hong Kong's housing issue is absolutely ridiculous. I have discussed this in my stand-up shows too. Hong Kong residents need to have 13 to 14 times their current annual salary to finally be qualified for home ownership.\" said the comedian. Up to 2013, he has done as much as thirteen shows. Seven of them were also performed in Australia, Canada and the United States. Dayo's latest talk show was performed on October 2014. A month later, the show was brought to Canada and the United States as well. In comparison with his stand-up comedy and TV dramas, his movies are not as successful. When being asked the reasons behind, he explained that his ultimate goal is to look for something new in his movies. His visions makes his work good to watch, but it is not good enough to attract people to pay for a cinema ticket. The second reason is that he hates doing promotion for his work."

  "text" : "David King-Wood (12 September 1913 – 3 September 2003) was a British actor. He was born in Tehran, Iran (then Persia), the youngest of four children. His father was William King Wood (CIE, CBE), Director of the Indo-European Telegraph Department and his mother was Daisy Adcock, daughter of Sir Hugh Adcock (who was once the physician to the Shah of Persia). He studied at Oxford University and was a keen member of OUDS (Oxford University Dramatic Society) appearing in The Radio Times in April 1936 whilst appearing as Richard II. David King-Wood (he apparently added the hyphen) appeared in British television and films during the 1950s. His Broadway credits include Friar Francis in Much Ado About Nothing (1959) and Adam Hartley in The Hidden River (1957). His British theatre credits include Measure for Measure and Richard III for The Old Vic, seasons with the Birmingham Repertory Company, the Oxford Repertory Company and the Worthing Repertory Company and the 1937 season at the Regent's Park Open Air Festival. He was also a regular performer with the Shakespeare Festival. His film credits include The Blakes Slept Here (1953) The Men of Sherwood Forest (1954) The Quatermass Xperiment (1955) and Jamboree (1957) among others. During the Second World War, his fluency in five languages, including Japanese, was used to the fore, but at the expense of his theatrical career. He relocated to New York in the mid-1950s and acted on Broadway for a number of years. David was also the \"it\" male model for a time and was the \"Marlboro Man\" for a couple of years. He ended his professional life teaching English and French at St. Bernard's School in New York, as well as directing the annual Shakespeare Play there. David loved nature, and as an enthusiastic New Yorker, spent many happy hours in Central Park. More than one hundred and fifty of his friends contributed to the David King-Wood Tree Fund, and two European Linden trees have been endowed in his name. There is a paving stone by the Olmsted Flowerbed at Literary Walk, mid-park at Sixty-Seventh Street, as well as the two trees near the East Meadow."

  "text" : "Faye Wong (born 8 August 1969) is a Chinese singer-songwriter and actress, often referred to as a \"diva\" (Chinese: 天后; literally: \"Heavenly Queen\") in Chinese-language media. Early in her career she briefly used the stage name Shirley Wong. Born in Beijing, she moved to British Hong Kong in 1987 and came to public attention in the early 1990s by singing ballads in Cantonese. Since 1994 she has recorded mostly in her native Mandarin, often combining alternative music with mainstream Chinese pop. In 2000 she was recognised by Guinness World Records as the Best Selling Canto-Pop Female. Following her second marriage in 2005 she withdrew from the limelight, but returned to the stage in 2010 amidst immense interest in the Sinophone world. Hugely popular in Mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore, she has also gained a large following in Japan. In the West she is perhaps best known for starring in Wong Kar-wai's films Chungking Express and 2046. While she has collaborated with international artists such as Cocteau Twins, Wong recorded only a few songs in English, including \"Eyes on Me\" – the theme song of the video game Final Fantasy VIII. Wong is known to be reserved in public, and has gained a reputation for her \"coolness\". In Encyclopedia of Contemporary Chinese Culture, Jeroen de Kloet characterised her as \"singer, actress, mother, celebrity, royalty, sex symbol and diva all at the same time\"."

Emney junior grew up in London and was educated at Cranleigh School. He made his film debut in 1935, having previously worked in music hall. He became a familiar figure to screen audiences, usually playing the \"posh fat bloke\", usually gruff and invariably wearing a monocle. During the 1950s, he had his own television show which featured sketches and deft piano pieces often composed by him. Some were released on record. He had a short spell as straight man to puppets Pinky and Perky. His sister Joan Emney was an actress who sometimes appeared with him in the same stage productions. Fred Emney died in Bognor Regis, Sussex on Christmas Day 1980."

Born in Ipoh, Malaysia, she was chosen by People as one of the \"50 Most Beautiful People in the World\" in 1997. She is best known in the Western world for her roles in the 1997 James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies, playing Wai Lin, and the multiple Academy Award–winning Chinese-language martial arts film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, for which she was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in 2000. In 2008, the film critic website Rotten Tomatoes ranked her the greatest action heroine of all time. In 2009, she was listed by People magazine – as the only Asian actress – as one of the \"35 All-Time Screen Beauties\". She is credited as Michelle Khan in some of her earlier films. This alias was chosen by the D&B studio who thought it might be more marketable to international and western audiences. Yeoh later preferred using her real name."

  "text" : "Mabel Lilian Poulton (29 July 1901 – 21 December 1994) was an English film actress, popular in Britain during the era of silent films. Born in Bethnal Green, London, England, Poulton worked as a stenographer and entered films by chance. Her first role in George Pearson's Nothing Else Matters (1920) was opposite Betty Balfour, who was also making her debut, and the film was a success. Over the next several years, Poulton was cast in a succession of roles, and usually played feisty or mischievous characters. A petite blonde, she also became well regarded for her fashion style, and was a highly recognisable celebrity. In 1928, she starred in The Constant Nymph by Adrian Brunel and received excellent reviews for her performance. By the end of the decade she was considered to be one of Britain's leading screen actresses along with Balfour, and was described by critics as Balfour's only serious rival. The advent of sound film brought a premature end to Poulton's film career. The addition of the microphone revealed Poulton's broad Cockney accent, which was at odds with the characters she had become identified with. Like Clara Bow who faced the same problem as a result of her Brooklyn accent, Poulton struggled to maintain her status. Also like Bow, she attempted to mount a comeback in the mid-1930s, which was well publicised but unsuccessful. She made her final film appearance in 1938. She spent her last years writing and re-writing a typescript about a young British starlet who is raped by a film director and who then descends into alcoholism. In biro, at some point of the writing process, she wrote in real names. Thomas Bentley is the director she accuses. She died in Merton, Surrey in 1994 aged 93."

  "text" : "Michael Melia (born 1945) is an established British actor best known for his work on television. Melia was born in Berkshire and attended St. Mary's College, Twickenham, the oldest Roman Catholic college in England. Before taking up acting he was a teacher. At one stage he ran a bar in Spain and thought about applying for a pub tenancy in England. However the idea was vetoed by his wife, former actress turned teacher, Celia Melia. He began acting in television in the early 1970s, usually playing heavies or policemen, though he spent four years performing classic plays with the National Theatre. He joined the BBC One soap opera EastEnders in 1990 as pub landlord Eddie Royle; however he lasted just over a year in this role as his character was killed off in September 1991 after being stabbed by Nick Cotton (John Altman) who was later tried for the murder but cleared. After leaving EastEnders, he appeared as Frank Dagley on Dangerfield; and, more recently, Jerry Block for over a hundred episodes of the footballing soap opera Dream Team. His rugged features have led to parts in numerous crime dramas: The Sweeney, The Bill, Minder in the Series 1 episode Monday Night Fever, C.A.T.S. Eyes, Campion, The Chinese Detective, Dempsey and Makepeace, Rumpole of the Bailey, Inspector Morse, Maigret, The Detectives, Daylight Robbery and New Tricks. He has also had parts in many other established dramas including When the Boat Comes In, Coronation Street, Casualty and most recently Doctors and Emmerdale. He is also known for having appeared on Doctor Who in full alien costume as the Terileptil Leader in the 1982 story The Visitation; and had a minor part on Blake's 7. He lives in Hampton Wick, Surrey with his wife and pet cat. He has two children, Tom and Charlotte, who have both appeared as extras in the EastEnders market square. More recently, he has appeared in short films, directed by his son Tom, which can be found on their website www.mean-eyedcat.co.uk.His daughter, Charlotte, also stars. In 2010, he guest starred in Dani's House."

Fans of the science fiction series Doctor Who will remember Greenstreet's performance as Ikona in the 1987 serial Time and the Rani. He directed and co-wrote his first feature film Caught in the Act in 1995, wrote and directed the highly acclaimed short film The 13th Protocol in 2005 and wrote and directed the psychological thriller \"Silent Hours\" starring James Weber Brown, Dervla Kirwan, Indira Varma and Hugh Bonneville in 2015.

Audreson wrote and directed two short films: The Man Who Could Read Minds (1999) and Eve Buckingham (2001) starring Susan Hampshire.

  "text" : "Margaret Lacey  (15 February 1910 – 4 October 1989) was a Welsh actress and ballet teacher. She lived in retirement at Wern, in the snowdonia village of Rowen, Conwy. She appeared in over 30 films between 1957 and 1985 mostly playing a sweet old lady or motherly figure in minor roles. She is perhaps best remembered internationally for starring in the 1971 James Bond film Diamonds Are Forever in which she played a seemingly innocent Christian school teacher who smuggled diamonds in her bible for the henchmen Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd. In the film, she was later found murdered and her body recovered out of an Amsterdam canal. She also had cameo role in John Schlesinger's 1961 semi-documentary \"Terminus\" as the elderly lady who lost her umbrella. She was friendly with Schlesinger and appeared in small parts in several of his films. For some years in the 1950s and 1960s she held regular dancing classes at the former Metropole Hotel in Colwyn Bay. Lacey also made appearances in Dr Finlays Casebook (1960s), Z-Cars and her last credited appearance was in Magnum, P.I. in 1985."

  "text" : "Michael Seymour Langham (22 August 1919 – 15 January 2011) was an English director and actor, who spent much of his career living and working in Canada and the United States. He was educated at Radley College and studied law at the University of London before enlisting in the British Army in 1939. After spending five years as a prisoner of war, Langham set his sights on the theatre and led several repertory theatres in the U.K. including Coventry (1946–48), Birmingham (1948–50) and Glasgow (1953–54). He was the second artistic director at the Stratford Festival in Canada from 1956 to 1967, and the third artistic director of the Guthrie Theater from 1971 to 1977. He was also director of the Juilliard School from 1979 to 1982, and again from 1987 to 1992. Langham's association with the Stratford Festival lasted over a half century as he directed Love's Labours Lost and There Reigns Love for the 2008 season. In 1995 he directed two plays for the inaugural season of the Atlantic Theatre Festival in Wolfville, Nova Scotia. Langham was married to actress Helen Burns. Their son is the writer, actor and comedian Chris Langham. Langham died on 15 January 2011 in Cranbrook, Kent, England after a short illness."

  "text" : "Marlo Lewis (September 15, 1915 – June 8, 1993) was an American executive producer of variety and comedy shows for CBS and is well known for co-producing the famous Ed Sullivan Show. Lewis was the son of a concert pianist and an opera singer. In the mid-1940s he became an executive of the Blaine Thompson Advertising agency, where he created and produced, together with his wife, Mina Bess, the daily radio talk show Luncheon at Sardi's. In 1948 Lewis co-created the Toast of the Town program with Ed Sullivan. In 1955, the TV classic was renamed The Ed Sullivan Show. Together with Sullivan, Lewis personally set the appearance time of each act for the show. In 1956, Elvis Presley appeared on the show, but he was censored because the rumor had it that the rock'n'roll singer had been \"hanging a small soft-drink bottle from his groin underneath his pants, and when he wiggles his leg it looks as though his pecker reaches down to his knee!\" Therefore, Lewis and Sullivan decided to shoot the singer only from the waist up during his TV performance. Apart from this show, Lewis also helped to launch The Jackie Gleason Show, The Dinah Shore Show and The Phil Silvers Show. After 12 years, he left the Sullivan Show in order to set up an independent production company. One of his first projects was the ballet The Nutcracker for an ABC Christmas special in 1961. In the mid-1960s, he produced several musical specials for Perry Como. In 1967, Lewis joined the Norman, Craig & Kummel agency and was elected vice chairman a year later. In 1979, he published, together with his wife, a book entitled Prime Time which includes many backstage stories from the author's times as a producer. Lewis was also a founder of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. Both Lewis and Sullivan shared the George Foster Peabody Award for humanitarian activities. In 1992, Lewis was elected to the Television Producers Hall of Fame. In 1993, he died of heart failure at his a hospital in Palm Springs, California. He is survived by his wife and two children."

  "text" : "Alyssa Meilin Gray is an American-Chinese pop singer and songwriter, based in Beijing, China. Meilin first appeared on Chinese national and worldwide television in 2006 with her younger sister, Suelin, winning first place on Beijing Television’s ‘Arts of Our Land’ competition, performing a traditional Chinese ‘hulusi’ flute duet. BTV’s Arts of Our Land competition (Wai Guo Ren Zhong Hua Cai Yi Da Sai), was China’s then-premier international competition for foreigners to showcase their talents in traditional Chinese art and culture. Following success on BTV’s ‘Arts of Our Land’, Meilin entered China Central Television’s ‘Xing Guang Da Dao’ Star Search competition, China’s foremost national talent competition, where she won first place in both the weekly and monthly competitions. In 2007, Meilin (梅琳) and Hong Kong singer and actor, Nicholas Tse, recorded the theme song and music video for Walt Disney’s Mandarin language release of the film ‘Beauty and the Beast’, which gave Meilin her first commercial success, with the song reaching No.2 on Pepsi’s Chinese Billboard Pop Charts."

  "text" : "Jia Hongsheng (simplified Chinese: 贾宏声; traditional Chinese: 賈宏聲; pinyin: Jiǎ Hóngshēng; 19 March 1967 – 5 July 2010) was a Chinese actor who became known in the late 1980s and early 1990s for roles in movies like The Case of the Silver Snake (1988), Good Morning, Beijing (1991), A Woman from North Shaanxi (1993) and Weekend Lover (1995). His performances were praised by critics and he developed a rebellious image that made him popular among artistic youth and the \"Sixth Generation\" of Chinese directors. However, he backed away from the limelight in 1995 after becoming addicted to cannabis and eventually heroin. His father, head of the local theatre in Jilin, retired two years before his retirement age, and along with his wife moved to Beijing to try to help Jia. He made a comeback in 2000, starring in the celebrated Suzhou River. The following year he starred in the film he is best known for to Western audiences, the autobiographical Quitting. It depicts his battle with addiction and his family trying to help him sober up, with all of the cast members being real people playing themselves."

She initiated her career in music first, only later beginning to work onstage in London. She appeared on stage in The Mask of Virtue with Vivien Leigh (1935), and in Agatha Christie's The Hollow. Her best-known films were Cottage to Let (1941) and Jamaica Inn (1939). She married English actor Colin Clive, best remembered for Frankenstein (1931), in June 1929, though they were later estranged for several years before his death on 25 June 1937 from tuberculosis. Her second husband, whom she married around 1938, was RAF Wing Commander Cowan Douglas Stephenson; they lived at Hunger Hatch near Ashford, Kent. Jeanne de Casalis died on 19 August 1966, aged 69."

  "text" : "Joan Kemp-Welch (1906–1999) was a British stage and film actress, who later went on to become a television director. After making her stage debut in 1926 at the Q Theatre, Kemp-Welch made her film debut in 1933 and appeared in fifteen films over the next decade largely in supporting or minor roles. Occasionally she played more substantial parts as in Hard Steel and They Flew Alone (both 1942). Post-Second World War, she moved into television working as both a producer and director of television films and episodes of television series. In 1959 she was one of the winners at the Society of Film and Television Arts Television Awards. In 1964 she directed A Midsummer Night's Dream for ITV's Play of the Week. The same year she directed four Noël Coward adaptations for A Choice of Coward. Other work included directing episodes of Upstairs, Downstairs and Armchair Theatre."

She was the only female member of Shōgun's massive cast of Japanese actors shown speaking English, for which she relied on a dialogue coach, as she was not fluent in the language at the time. Her English improved greatly during the production, however, allowing her to work in a few English language films during the 1980s and 1990s. In 1981, she won the Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actress in a TV-Series-Drama and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy award for her work on Shōgun"

  "text" : "Yam Kim Fai (Chinese: 任劍輝, 4 February 1913 (Lunar 29 December 1912) – 29 November 1989), also known as Ren Jianhui was a renowned Cantonese opera actress in China and Hong Kong. She was most notable for her unique ability to sing in the lower register. That her opera voice was indistinguishable from a male one allowed her to play either male or female roles, though she usually performed male ones. Miss Universe 1976, the 25th Miss Universe pageant, was held on 11 July 1976 at the Lee Theatre in Hong Kong. From five portraits, contestants were asked to pick one that she/they could identify, as the only actress instead of an actor, in Cantonese opera costume. Yam was not the one she/they picked. In 1972, TV viewers looked for the \"man\" they knew from movies/stage performances when Yam performed the last time in public. They did not expect to see her in a 2-piece set of jacket and qipao (cheongsam) with floral print. Since 1972, Yam enjoyed singing in private with a live band and was often accompanied by her protégée Loong who would read the lyrics out for her until her eyesight improved with surgery."

She was often cast as conniving, plotting characters. Yang became an actress in 1984 after previously working as a bank employee. She had attended an acting class with her sister, actress Yang Libing, and then joined the Singapore Broadcasting Corporation, which is now part of MediaCorp. Her most well known roles included the 1986 film, Neighbours, and Samsui Women. She married her husband, a make-up artist, in 1992. She took two professional breaks from acting to give birth to her two daughters. Yang opened a hair salon with her sister in 2004. She was diagnosed with uterine cancer during the late 2000s, but continued to act sporadically. Her last role was in the second season of Perfect Cut, in which she portrayed a wealthy, lonely woman who was dying from AIDS. She died of cancer in the home of her younger sister, Yang Libing, on March 20, 2010. Her age was unknown. She is survived by her husband, two daughters and sister."

  "text" : "Norman Evans (11 June 1901 – 25 November 1962) was a variety and radio performer, born in Rochdale, Lancashire, England. Evans was discovered by fellow Rochdale entertainer Gracie Fields. The act for which he is best remembered was \"Over the Garden Wall\", in which he played Fanny Fairbottom, a toothless hatchet-faced Lancastrian housewife gossiping over a garden wall, The routine was the inspiration for Les Dawson and Roy Barraclough's later Cissie and Ada characters. The one-sided conversations would embrace local gossip, including scandal about the neighbours and personal medical complaints, including silently mouthing words deemed too rude to be spoken out loud, and accompanied with a range of facial contortions and glances round for supposed eavesdroppers. Another famous stage sketch was \"The Dentist\" in which Evans played both patient and dentist, and in which he employed a large screen. His first appearance on the London stage was alongside a young Betty Driver. Evans was the only pantomime dame to receive top billing at the London Palladium. His final summer season was at Butlin's Holiday Camp, Pwllheli in 1962. He wrote to Clarkson Rose (another top pantomime dame) \"Working in a Butlin theatre is a terrific experience, and although I've not been too well, I've never been happier in my life\". Norman Evans is buried in Carleton Cemetery, Blackpool. The headstone of his grave is a low wall built from natural gritstone blocks. His epitaph (preceding birth and death dates) reads \"Norman's last garden wall!\""

  "text" : "Norm Grabowski (February 5, 1933 – October 12, 2012) was an American hot rod builder and actor. The heavy set crew cut-wearing Grabowski appeared in minor roles in many films produced by Albert Zugsmith and Walt Disney. He was Polish-American. In 1952, after leaving military service, Grabowski built a hot rod based on a shortened 1922 Ford Model T touring car mated to a similarly extremely shortened Model A pickup truck bed. With a powerful Cadillac overhead valve engine that came from his parents' sedan, the vehicle that resulted had a unique appearance and stance which inspired many hot rods created afterward. The car was first featured on the cover of the October, 1955 issue of Hot Rod Magazine and then underwent further modifications, including a greater rake, tilted windshield and blue paint with flames when it famously appeared in color on the cover of the April, 1957 issue of Car Craft magazine as well as in the April 29, 1957 issue of Life Magazine. Grabowski's hugely influential T-bucket hot rod, which became known as the Kookie Kar, was used in the television show 77 Sunset Strip. The car was owned and driven in the show by the character Kookie who was played by Edd Byrnes. As a consequence of the magazine exposure, Grabowski was approached about renting the car out to appear in movies and television shows. The contacts he made in this way led to an acting career for Grabowski. He appeared in television shows, including The Monkees, Batman (episodes 39 and 40 in 1966) and The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis, and films such as High School Confidential (1958), The Beat Generation (1959), The Big Operator (1959), Girls Town (1959), College Confidential (1960), Sex Kittens Go to College (1960), The Misadventures of Merlin Jones (1964), Roustabout (1964), Girl Happy (1965), The Monkey's Uncle (1965), Out of Sight (1966), Blackbeard's Ghost (1968), The Towering Inferno (1974), Hooper (1978) and The Cannonball Run (1981). Grabowski was known as a wood carver, and many hot rods and custom cars feature his unique hand-carved skull gearshift knobs. He retired from acting in the 1980s after The Cannonball Run. Grabowski died the morning of October 12, 2012, at the age of 79."

He appeared in more than one hundred television dramas on the BBC and ITV during the course of his career, including Our Friends in the North, Poldark and House of Cards. Selby was also a long-standing member of the Royal Shakespeare Company. Selby was born in London on 13 September 1925. He served in the British army during World War II, making his stage debut in Dangerous Corner at Preston, Lancashire, for the forces' entertainment organisation ENSA. In 1948 he enrolled at the Central School of Speech and Drama, receiving commendation for his student performance in Mary Hayley Bell's Men in Shadow. There then followed seasons in repertory at Liverpool, Birmingham, Coventry, York, Hornchurch and Cambridge. His first professional West End appearance was in 1959, in William Douglas-Home's Aunt Edwina. In 1963 Selby made his first appearances for the Royal Shakespeare Company, as Casca in Julius Caesar, the Bishop of Winchester in The Wars of The Roses and Antonio in The Tempest. His association with the company lasted for ten years, until he followed Peter Hall to the new National Theatre in London in 1976. In his first season there he appeared as Menander in Tamburlaine and the Captain in Tales from the Vienna Woods. He was van Swieten in the inaugural production Amadeus and the parliamentary Speaker in The Madness of George III. His last stage role was as Dilly Knox in Breaking the Code in 1987. Selby died in London on 14 September 2010, at the age of 85. He was preceded by his wife, Kathleen Rayner, for whom he had been caring during her ill-health for many years."
