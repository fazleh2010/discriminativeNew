  "text" : "Richard Cowley (died 1619) was an actor in English Renaissance theatre, a colleague of William Shakespeare and Richard Burbage in the Lord Chamberlain's Men and the King's Men. Cowley was in the c. 1591 production of The Seven Deadly Sins, performed by personnel from the Admiral's Men and Lord Strange's Men — a production that included Richard Burbage and other future King's Men. Cowley acted seven minor roles in that production. He also toured with some of the same personnel under Edward Alleyn in 1593. He is thought to have been an original shareholder in the Lord Chamberlain's Men when they re-formed in 1594; but little is known about his career, except for the fact that he played Verges in Much Ado About Nothing, along with William Kempe as Dogberry. For some reason he is not in the cast lists on the three Ben Jonson plays acted by the company in 1598–1603; but he is still one of the sharers when the company is chartered as the King's Men in 1603, and he receives a bequest in the 1605 will of Augustine Phillips. He is known to have married and had four children; two died young. His wife Elizabeth was buried on 28 September 1616 and his own burial followed on 12 March 1619. His will was witnessed by Cuthbert Burbage, John Heminges, Thomas Ravenscroft, and John Shank."

This included a two-person production with Sladen in Mooney and his Caravans. A notable TV appearance was Miller playing the husband of Sladen in the ITV drama Send In The Girls. Miller and their daughter, Sadie Miller, performed with Sladen in a number of Sarah Jane Smith audio plays, released by Big Finish Productions.

In his book The Stage Struck Me! fellow actor Neville Phillips felt Sinclair always played variations of himself, handsome, debonair, suave and witty and excelled in light comedy. By contrast Phillips felt his wife, who Sinclair often appeared opposite, was a dramatic actress of tremendous power with a magnificent voice. Sinclair appeared both on Broadway and on the West End. His screen work began in British films. His most notable role possibly is Leslie Charteris' The Saint in The Saint's Vacation followed by The Saint Meets the Tiger. Sinclair died in Slapton, England at the age of 59."

Chen was educated at the now defunct Serangoon Garden Secondary Technical School. He joined the SBC after completing the 5th artiste drama training class and made his debut in 1984. He holds a black belt in taekwondo and his martial arts background led him to being cast in many wuxia dramas in the 1990s and as characters with fight scenes in other drama series. He is also a member of the Singapore Celebrity Soccer Team. The Straits Times remarked that Chen's \"much-praised understated turn\" in the Cannes Film Festival award-winning Ilo Ilo put him in the spotlight once again. Chen hit the headlines again when two parody music videos he starred in, went viral. The first, titled \"Unbelievable\", was 'lauded' for the nonsensical line 'I so stunned like vegetable' (sic), drawing the attention of TIME, while the second, \"Sandcastle in My Heart\", in which Irene Ang also starred in, did not become as popular as the previous one. Both videos are a parody of popular Chinese MVs in the 1970s, particularly the work of Singaporean singer Huang Ching Yuan."

  "text" : "Margaret Lacey  (15 February 1910 – 4 October 1989) was a Welsh actress and ballet teacher. She lived in retirement at Wern, in the snowdonia village of Rowen, Conwy. She appeared in over 30 films between 1957 and 1985 mostly playing a sweet old lady or motherly figure in minor roles. She is perhaps best remembered internationally for starring in the 1971 James Bond film Diamonds Are Forever in which she played a seemingly innocent Christian school teacher who smuggled diamonds in her bible for the henchmen Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd. In the film, she was later found murdered and her body recovered out of an Amsterdam canal. She also had cameo role in John Schlesinger's 1961 semi-documentary \"Terminus\" as the elderly lady who lost her umbrella. She was friendly with Schlesinger and appeared in small parts in several of his films. For some years in the 1950s and 1960s she held regular dancing classes at the former Metropole Hotel in Colwyn Bay. Lacey also made appearances in Dr Finlays Casebook (1960s), Z-Cars and her last credited appearance was in Magnum, P.I. in 1985."

  "text" : "Marlo Lewis (September 15, 1915 – June 8, 1993) was an American executive producer of variety and comedy shows for CBS and is well known for co-producing the famous Ed Sullivan Show. Lewis was the son of a concert pianist and an opera singer. In the mid-1940s he became an executive of the Blaine Thompson Advertising agency, where he created and produced, together with his wife, Mina Bess, the daily radio talk show Luncheon at Sardi's. In 1948 Lewis co-created the Toast of the Town program with Ed Sullivan. In 1955, the TV classic was renamed The Ed Sullivan Show. Together with Sullivan, Lewis personally set the appearance time of each act for the show. In 1956, Elvis Presley appeared on the show, but he was censored because the rumor had it that the rock'n'roll singer had been \"hanging a small soft-drink bottle from his groin underneath his pants, and when he wiggles his leg it looks as though his pecker reaches down to his knee!\" Therefore, Lewis and Sullivan decided to shoot the singer only from the waist up during his TV performance. Apart from this show, Lewis also helped to launch The Jackie Gleason Show, The Dinah Shore Show and The Phil Silvers Show. After 12 years, he left the Sullivan Show in order to set up an independent production company. One of his first projects was the ballet The Nutcracker for an ABC Christmas special in 1961. In the mid-1960s, he produced several musical specials for Perry Como. In 1967, Lewis joined the Norman, Craig & Kummel agency and was elected vice chairman a year later. In 1979, he published, together with his wife, a book entitled Prime Time which includes many backstage stories from the author's times as a producer. Lewis was also a founder of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. Both Lewis and Sullivan shared the George Foster Peabody Award for humanitarian activities. In 1992, Lewis was elected to the Television Producers Hall of Fame. In 1993, he died of heart failure at his a hospital in Palm Springs, California. He is survived by his wife and two children."

In 2006 she was in the cast of a well-received UK touring production of Noël Coward’s Star Quality. She appeared in two series-three episodes of Rising Damp, as Caroline Armitage.

He is considered by many as a bridge between traditional Chinese martial arts and modern wushu for his successful integration of traditional and modern techniques at a level of fluidity, technique, and explosiveness that had not been seen before, and which has yet to have been matched today. He is a former Shanxi wushu team athlete trained by the coaches Pang Lin Tai and Zhang Ling Mei. He became the standard that other athletes were judged by in the nineties: his personal long fist and staff forms were famously made into the compulsory wushu guiding forms which other athletes had to perform and compete in."
