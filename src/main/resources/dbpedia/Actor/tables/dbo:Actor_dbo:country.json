Cowley acted seven minor roles in that production. He also toured with some of the same personnel under Edward Alleyn in 1593. He is thought to have been an original shareholder in the Lord Chamberlain's Men when they re-formed in 1594; but little is known about his career, except for the fact that he played Verges in Much Ado About Nothing, along with William Kempe as Dogberry. For some reason he is not in the cast lists on the three Ben Jonson plays acted by the company in 1598–1603; but he is still one of the sharers when the company is chartered as the King's Men in 1603, and he receives a bequest in the 1605 will of Augustine Phillips. He is known to have married and had four children; two died young. His wife Elizabeth was buried on 28 September 1616 and his own burial followed on 12 March 1619. His will was witnessed by Cuthbert Burbage, John Heminges, Thomas Ravenscroft, and John Shank."

  "text" : "Robert Cox (died December 1655) was a seventeenth-century English actor, best known for creating and performing the \"drolls\" that were a permitted form of dramatic entertainment during the English Civil War and the Interregnum, when theatres were officially closed and standard plays were not allowed. Gerard Langbaine called Cox an \"excellent comedian.\" His origins and early history are obscure; he was with Beeston's Boys in 1639, but nothing else is known about his early life. \"Cox probably was a strolling or country player...\" through much of his career. Cox had one known connection with one of the theatre companies of the era: he was one of ten men who tried to re-organize the King's Men in December 1648, an attempt that, perhaps unsurprisingly, did not succeed. Cox won his personal fame in writing and performing drolls — interludes or farces that usually consisted of comic scenes extracted and adapted from old dramas of English Renaissance theatre, by William Shakespeare (Bottom the Weaver was one droll), Ben Jonson, John Fletcher, and many others. Cox created at least eleven drolls, with titles like Simpleton the Smith, Bumpkin, Hobbinat, Simpkin, and John Swabber the Seaman. As a performer, Cox was said to have been \"irresistible\" in his role of Young Simpleton. Cox performed most often at the Red Bull Theatre, long a center of popular entertainment. By some reports he bribed local officials into looking the other way when his drolls grew too much like plays. If so, he was not entirely successful in his corruption: Puritan authorities raided the Red Bull in June 1653 looking for unauthorized drama, and found Cox, playing Swabber. The gentry among the audience were required to pay five-shilling fines to exit. A selection of Cox's drolls, including Simpleton, Oenone, and Acteon and Diana, was published by the bookseller Edward Archer in 1656. Francis Kirkman printed some of Cox's drolls in his famous collections The Wits, or Sport upon Sport (1662, 1672)."

  "text" : "Robert Dawes (fl. 1610 – 1614) was an English actor of the Jacobean era. He is unique in the extant records of English Renaissance theatre, in that his individual employment contract with one of his acting companies has survived. Dawes was an early and perhaps an original member and \"sharer\" (a partner who shared in the profits, rather than a hired man who worked for a wage) with Prince Charles's Men, from at least 1610 on. He remained with that company only until 1614, however, when he left for the Lady Elizabeth's Men. Dawes was admitted as a sharer in the Lady Elizabeth's troupe; his personal 3-year contract with managers Philip Henslowe and Jacob Meade, dated 7 April of that year, spells out a schedule of graduated penalties for minor and major infractions of the rules:"

  "text" : "Philip Bowen is a British actor who has appeared in a number of British film and television roles including in Agatha Christie's Poirot, Kavanagh QC and Soldier Soldier. He was born in Sutton Coldfield, Warwickshire, in 1946. Phil’s professional career started at Leatherhead in Puss in Boots playing the back end of the donkey. Seasons in rep followed at Guildford, Derby, Nottingham, Birmingham, Oxford and Newcastle as well as television, radio and some film work in Hollywood. Foreign touring for the British Council, including three years with Sir Michael Redgrave coupled with seasons at Regent’s Park and the Young Vic where he played Hamlet directed by Michael Bogdanov, developed a love for Shakespeare. Associations with Tim Carroll, Master of Verse at Shakespeare’s Globe, included touring Germany and playing Prospero in Maidstone Prison with the inmates playing the other parts. He met his wife, Susannna Best, while they were touring with the English Shakespeare Company and together they set up the charity, Shakespeare Link. Their vision was to access Shakespeare beyond the confines of theatre or academe, as a stimulus for communication and debate. They worked in the community, with therapists, with young people and senior citizens as well as in hospitals and prisons; teaching, directing and performing took them to Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Beirut, the Philippines, Tunisia, Mauritius, Indonesia, Malaysia, the US and Canada.Now settled on the family smallholding in the Upper Wye Valley they have been translating Shakespeare into BSL, working with local schools and groups and running ‘Have-a-go Shakespeare’ sessions with all comers. In 2006 they headed up a team to plant the magical Willow Globe, woven of living willow and open to the sky, which they run both as a producing and a receiving house. Such is the success of the Willow Globe Community Company, under Phil’s guidance, that it has been invited to play CADW heritage sites and, by the RSC, to perform at Stratford. In 1996 Phil founded 'Shakespeare Link' with his wife, Susanna Best (mother of the actress Eve Best), and is focused on broadening the appeal and accessibility of Shakespeare. This work was further extended with the establishment of the Willow Globe theatre on land at their home near Llanwrthwl, Powys in Wales."

He was in the Admiral's Men/Lord Strange's Men production of The Seven Deadly Sins, c. 1591, with Augustine Phillips and William Sly and other future Lord Chamberlain's Men. Bryan may also have toured with the same group of actors under Edward Alleyn in 1593. He is generally believed to have been one of the original members and sharers in the Lord Chamberlain's Men when that company was re-constituted in 1594; he certainly was a key member in 1596, when he and John Heminges received payment for a performance at Court. After that point, however, he apparently left the theatrical profession; he seems to have quit acting around 1597. He hadn't died: in 1603 and in the 1611–13 period, he was recorded as a Groom of the Chamber under James I."

While living with his uncle he reluctantly trained as an engineer at a colliery: it was at the colliery that he first became interested in acting when he organised concerts for the workforce. He won a scholarship to train at RADA while still working at the colliery. In 1938 he married Judith Cope. Working in repertory theatre, his theatrical career was interrupted by World War II during which he served in Burma. Returning to the theatre after the war, he became a playwright and appeared on various TV shows and films. In 1947 he married Helen A. Syme at Cuckfield in Sussex. On Broadway he appeared as Sir Francis Getliffe in The Affair at the Henry Miller Theatre (1962) and as Major Hugh Beresford Maitland in Hostile Witness at the Music Box Theatre (1966). His 1978 farce Caught Napping starred Arthur Lowe, Bill Pertwee and Edward Evans. His best known role was as Captain Square in Dad's Army, the pompous commander of the Eastgate platoon of the Home Guard who was a rival of Captain Mainwaring. Other TV appearances included Rookery Nook, Upstairs, Downstairs, It Ain't Half Hot Mum and Edward & Mrs. Simpson. Lumsden died in London in 1984 aged 69."

  "text" : "Gary Hailes (born 4 November 1965 in London) is an English actor. Hales attended Holloway School. During the 1980s he starred in several successful television series, including Woodentop, Grange Hill and the BBC soap opera EastEnders, where he played Barry Clark from 1986-89. He originally auditioned for the role of Mark Fowler when the series began in 1985, but the role went to David Scarboro instead. Hailes' character was notable for being one half of the soap's first gay couple, introduced as the partner of the yuppie graphic designer, Colin Russell (played by Michael Cashman). In 1987 Hailes' character caused a great deal of controversy after EastEnders screened the first male-to-male kiss on a UK, prime time soap. The kiss prompted a multitude of complaints from angry viewers and a hostile backlash from the right wing press. Despite the fact that Hailes is heterosexual, he suffered from severe homophobia because of the homosexual role he played in EastEnders. He was attacked several times by members of the public who couldn't separate fact from fiction, which included being assaulted in a supermarket by a disapproving woman and strangled by a man at a petrol station. Even after he left the show he lost a job as a children's television presenter because of the so-called \"gay tag\". Since leaving EastEnders in 1989, he has gone on to appear in films such as The Killing Zone (1999); Murder with Mirrors and Waiting for a Killer. On television he has appeared in ITV police drama The Bill (2001–02); Horizon; Nobody’s Hero; Sorry and the BBC’s production of Pinocchio. Theatre appearances include Strip Poker; Doctor on the Boil; Gollocks and numerous pantomimes. He has also performed several plays for BBC radio and voice-overs and had a regular slot \"Hailes Horrors\" on the Steve Allen show on LBC radio. As well as acting, Hailes also drives a London taxi."

  "text" : "Strelsa Brown was an English film actress who was born in 1919 in Tientsin, China. Born as Edna Pearl Brown, her film career began with an uncredited part in The Ghosts of Berkeley Square in 1947. Her most noteworthy film credit is Quo Vadis. She played the role of Rufia in a film that earned numerous Academy Award nominations. Other films in which she appeared include Love I Haven't (1951), Sappho venere di Lesbo (1960), and Romanoff and Juliet (1961). Brown's true name is Edna Brown Muss. She was married to Henry Muss, an infantry soldier, who was a World War II hero. Muss was killed in action in 1945. In 1962, Brown claimed that she was owed between $2 and $3 million of a fortune begun by New York builder Isaac Muss, the father of Henry Muss. No will was left. Until then she had lived purely on her war pension from the US. She had given up acting on stage as a soubrette,due to her age,to look after her son David. The brothers and sisters of her husband, Henry Muss, just prior to 1962 had given her an ultimatum..sign that she agreed one of the wealthiest men in New York had left a total amount of $20.000 and they would continue to send $100 a month to her...(money they had started strangely to send just one year before at the time Isaac Muss had died) or else they would stop the monthly cheque. They stopped the monthly cheque and her son could not go to university. He was lucky enough to be put in contact with a wealthy friend of his grandmother who happened, like David, to be living in Italy. She. Mary Duyvendaak, gave David $80 a month so he could resume studies and continued this gift until he graduated in medicine in 1968. His mother never remarried and eventually committed suicide in 1976."

From 2014 - 2015 her work has incorporated radio comedy, short film making and art installation. In 2014 DIS_CONNECT at the New Red Studios posed questions about how real our connection is with one another in a seemingly interconnected world. Have we become more disconnected? It involved red tape, umbrellas, briefcases, data collection, public information broadcasts and a bit of Cat Stevens. In 2013 She performed a new satire about the Pythia of Delphi at the Sir John Soane's Museum in London. She appeared in the BBC Radio comedy programme Hudson & Pepperdine Save the Planet as Marina, the fast talking manic depressive. Notable performances include Frankie in the Chichester Festival Theatre production of the Rodney Ackland play \"After October\" with Dorothy TutinTHEATRE: After October; Chichester Festival Theatre Paul Taylor. Ackland assembles a sizeable group of people whose hopes are hanging on Clive's play being a hit. These range from his sister, Joan (Maria Miles) - who, freed from dependency on her philistine of a lover, will be able to attend art school - to the depressive paying guest Frankie (an excellent Samantha Holland), who will be able to marry Clive and get rid of the well-meaning but boring Brian (Gregory Floy) with his stuffy old colonial slang (\"feeling pretty bobbish, thanks\") and his formulaic generosity. Tessa Bold in David Farr's play Max Klapper - A Life in Pictures at the Electric Cinema Her Edinburgh One Woman Show \"Am I Losing my Mind or Just my Figure\" was selected as part of the pick of the Edinburgh Festival Pleasance Fringe in 2001. The comedian and writer Nick Revell selected it as part of his pick of the week on BBC Radio Scotland, and it garnered four stars in The Scotsman."

  "text" : "Terry Scully (13 May 1932 – 17 April 2001) was a British theatre and television actor. After making his name in the theatre, from the 1960s onwards he became more known for TV work. In 1960 he starred in the BBC's production of An Age of Kings, playing King Henry VI in several episodes. Other notable roles for Scully were as Horatio Nelson in the 1968 television series, Triton, and as Bicket in the BBC's 1967 blockbuster adaptation of The Forsyte Saga. He also appeared in Dixon of Dock Green, Z-Cars, Softly, Softly, Callan, Public Eye, The Venturers, and Angels. Like many actors of his generation, he is now probably best remembered for his roles in Cult TV series, due to their enduring appeal - even though they were no more notable, at the time, than his many other TV roles. He appeared in the Doctor Who serial The Seeds of Death, the Blake's 7 episode \"Dawn of the Gods\" and starred as Vic Thatcher in four episodes of the 1970s series Survivors. During his time on that series, Scully suffered a nervous breakdown. As a result, his role was filled by actor Hugh Walters in subsequent episodes. In 2001 he died of a stroke, aged 68."

  "text" : "Keith Jayne (born 10 December 1960) is a British actor, known for playing the title role in the 1981 television adaptation Stig of the Dump. A slow growth rate, due to a pituitary gland problem, made Keith a target of bullies at grammar school. To escape them, he enrolled with The Barbara Speake Stage School. Early roles were in Rumpole of the Bailey, Angels and a variety of Children's Film Foundation productions, including Robin Hood Junior (1975), The Glitterball (1977) and Sammy's Super T-Shirt (1978).In 1974, Keith appeared as Wilfred Schoenfeld in an episode of Upstairs, Downstairs, entitled \"The Beastly Hun\". In 1975, he played Mick in Survivors. However, his big break happened in 1979 when he was cast as Tom Arnold, a cabin boy, in The Onedin Line. This was followed by the lead role in Thames Television’s, BAFTA award nominated, adaptation of Stig of The Dump - which 'is probably the part I am most remembered for'. Keith went on to play 'Boxer Reed' in all 54 episodes of Central TV's kid’s drama, Murphy's Mob. His appearance as Will Chandler - 'one of the most convincing and memorable companions The Doctor never had' – in Doctor Who serial The Awakening, led producer John Nathan-Turner to briefly consider making Keith a series regular. Typecasting (often as a yokel) persuaded Keith to study for a certificate in Finance and Investment. This coincided with a dark period his life, when his earlier health problems came back to haunt him. 'As a result of the growth hormone treatment I received as a child, I received a letter from the NHS saying I may have contracted CJD.' Keith’s high profile saw him interviewed on ITN, a broadcast that curtailed his acting career. 'The fact that it was reported that I was dying did not help me get any further work as no casting director is going to employ you if there is a chance you will keel over before episode two.' Having run a financial services business for the last 22 years, Keith is planning on a return to acting. Looking for an agent he has already made a brief return to television, as a guest in the 'Blast From The Past' section of The Justin Lee Collins Show."

  "text" : "Ben Holden Driver Warriss (29 May 1909 – 14 January 1993), known as Ben Warriss, was an English comedian and the first cousin of fellow comedy actor Jimmy Jewel. Allegedly the two cousins were born in the same bed (at different times) and brought up in the same household at 52 Andover Street, Sheffield. He was the son of Benjamin Holden Joseph Warriss, an insurance company inspector, and his wife, Mary Ann, née Driver, Jewel's mother's sister. He first performed on the stage in 1930. Jimmy Jewel and Ben Warriss came together as professionals in 1934 at the Palace Theatre, Newcastle. Their double act achieved seven Royal Variety Performances, 12 Blackpool summer seasons, a successful radio series (Up the Pole) and a film of the series. Around 1966, the two went their separate ways, with Warriss performing on stage and Jewel moving into television. In the 1970s Warriss was the resident compere at the Cala Gran club in Fleetwood, Lancashire. In 1988 he played the Emperor of China in the first of the newly reopened Hackney Empire pantomimes, Aladdin. He was still performing in pantomime in his eighties. The character Parker from the 1960s TV series of Thunderbirds is said to have been based upon Warriss' appearance. His first wife, whom he married on 22 September 1934, was Grace Mary Skinner (b. 1910-11), a dancer and teacher of dancing and daughter of Henry Arthur James Skinner, master mariner. This marriage had ended by about 1940 and two years later Warriss married the entertainer Meggie Easton. His third marriage, which took place about 1960, was to Virginia Vernon. He died in 1993 at Brinsworth House, Staines Road, Twickenham, and is buried in the same section of Streatham Park Cemetery, London, as comedian Will Hay."

  "text" : "Lee MacDonald (born 21 June 1968) is a British actor who played Zammo McGuire in the children's TV series Grange Hill from 1982-1987. Since then he has made cameo appearances on Birds of a Feather, The Bill and a TV version of A Midsummer Night's Dream. He trained as a boxer, but a car crash left him unable to fight any more. He now runs a locksmith-and-key-cutting shop in Wallington, Surrey. He learned this trade while filming Grange Hill, and opened his business around 1999. He appeared in the Sky One show Cirque de Celebrité until he was voted out on the fourth show. He was however invited back when Sophie Anderton left due to injury, but was again voted out on the seventh show of the series. MacDonald filmed a pilot for a series entitled Cabbies for ITV: he also appeared as a travel correspondent on BroadbandTV. In October 2008, MacDonald appeared in BBC Three's Celebrity Scissorhands, where celebrities learned to cut hair and do other beauty treatments, raising money for BBC Children In Need. In September 2016, MacDonald appeared on an edition of ITV's Who's doing the dishes?."

  "text" : "Hugh Clark (died 1653) was a prominent English actor of the Caroline era. He worked in both of the main theatre companies of his time, Queen Henrietta's Men and the King's Men. Clark was with Queen Henrietta's Men during the first and most significant phase of their existence, from 1625 to 1636. Like some other actors of English Renaissance theatre, Clark began as a boy player filling female roles. He played Gratiana in Shirley's The Wedding in 1626, and Bess Bridges in both parts of Heywood's The Fair Maid of the West in 1630–31.Not long after that time, though, Clark switched to adult male roles. He played Syphax and Nuntius in Nabbes's Hannibal and Scipio (1635), and Hubert in Davenport's King John and Matilda. The Queen Henrietta's company was disrupted and fractured by the bubonic plague epidemic of 1636–37. Clark, like some other members of the troupe, disappears from the available records in 1637 and 1638; he may have been one of several actors from the company who travelled with James Shirley to Dublin to work at the Werburgh Street Theatre. By 1639, however, Clark was back in London and a member of the King's Men; he appeared in their revival of The Custom of the Country in that year. He was a sharer in the company by January 1641, when he was one of the six sharers who were named Grooms of the Chamber. As a member of the company, he was one of the ten actors who signed the dedication of the first Beaumont and Fletcher folio in 1647. He was also involved in the January 1648 attempt to revive the company (which failed by the summer of that year, when the actors missed a payment due), despite the fact that the theatres had been closed by the Puritan regime of the English Commonwealth."

  "text" : "Antonia de Sancha (born 14 September 1961 in Hammersmith, London) is an English actress and businesswoman best known as the former mistress of British Conservative Member of Parliament and Cabinet minister David Mellor which became public knowledge in 1992. She is the daughter of a Spanish film producer father, who died in the mid-1980s, and a Swedish mother who, suffering from severe depression, committed suicide 18 months later, shortly before her daughter began studies at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. At the time of the revelations of her affair, de Sancha was described by some news outlets as a \"soft-porn actress\" because she had played the part of a prostitute in a film in which she had simulated sex. The film \"The Pieman\" also featured John Hemming-Clark, leader of political party Independents to Save Queen Mary's Hospital, as de Sancha's husband. Although \"The Pieman\" has never been on general release, an account of the plot can be found in Hemming-Clark's book, In You Go! A year or two in the life of a scout leader. The affair with Mellor was a contributory factor in his subsequent resignation from the cabinet on 24 September 1992. Believing her acting career was ruined and aware that newspapers were making money out of the story and she wasn't, de Sancha hired publicist Max Clifford to sell her story to various newspapers. She made about £30,000 from those sales. The furore that followed publication left her deeply unhappy. \"It was emotional rape\", de Sancha told an interviewer ten years after the scandal referring to the bugging of her flat which led to the affair being made public. She has had scarcely any work as an actress since the scandal, and considers the scandal as the reason a subsequent marriage failed. She was the subject of an instalment of the Discovery Channel documentary series The Mistress in 2002. De Sancha now runs an Indian textiles importing business in Portobello Road, Kensington, west London."

Despite lacking passion for the law, Murphy pursued a career as a corporate lawyer, first in England then in Paris, France. In Paris he met and married his second wife. Murphy began to paint “to relieve the boredom of corporate law.” Murphy’s first painting exhibition in 1991 in London was a great success, and his colorful Gauguin-esque paintings became highly desirable. In 1992, Murphy and his new wife relocated from Paris to a large country house near Carcassonne in the south of France. He continues to paint and exhibit work, but he rarely leaves the Languedoc."

Chen was educated at the now defunct Serangoon Garden Secondary Technical School. He joined the SBC after completing the 5th artiste drama training class and made his debut in 1984. He holds a black belt in taekwondo and his martial arts background led him to being cast in many wuxia dramas in the 1990s and as characters with fight scenes in other drama series. He is also a member of the Singapore Celebrity Soccer Team. The Straits Times remarked that Chen's \"much-praised understated turn\" in the Cannes Film Festival award-winning Ilo Ilo put him in the spotlight once again. Chen hit the headlines again when two parody music videos he starred in, went viral. The first, titled \"Unbelievable\", was 'lauded' for the nonsensical line 'I so stunned like vegetable' (sic), drawing the attention of TIME, while the second, \"Sandcastle in My Heart\", in which Irene Ang also starred in, did not become as popular as the previous one. Both videos are a parody of popular Chinese MVs in the 1970s, particularly the work of Singaporean singer Huang Ching Yuan."

  "text" : "Forbes Collins is a versatile British character actor, seen in supporting roles. The serious demeanour he gives to some of the 'country-fied' characters he has played is lent gravity via a down-to-earth manner combined with his trademark serious expression. He is best known for his role as King John in the popular comedy Maid Marian and Her Merry Men. He also starred in the episode All About Scoring, Innit? in the critically acclaimed drama, Minder, playing Arklow, as well as appearing as Jonas in Jesus of Nazareth, some episodes of the first series of Blackadder, and playing the Chief Officer in Doctor Who's Vengeance on Varos. Collins also played Zacky Martin in Poldark (1975), playing a leading male member in the village of Sawle and supporter of Captain Poldark, whose house Nampara was nearby. When the villagers of Sawle try one of their own for murder, Zacky is prominent in leading the process, advocating using \"the old way\". This uses a candle which, should it stop burning before the end, is taken as 'proof' of guilt. In Poldark, with 'sentence' passed, as the 'guilty' man (who professes his genuine guilt) is taken away, the viewer sees that the wick in the candle had been pre-cut, and the flame would have naturally extinguished anyway. In the quietly memorable and chilling scene that follows, the 'guilty' man is hurled from the cliffs to his death. Other appearances include the 1974 \"Dixon Of Dock Green\" episode, \"Seven For A Secret - Never To Be Told\". His character, Pengelly, appears to have withheld information from Dock Green police who are investigating the death of a woman in a gas explosion. He has also played policemen himself, notably Chief Superintendent Bailey in three episodes of the P. D. James-penned Adam Dalgliesh story, \"Shroud For A Nightingale\" (which TV mini-series starred Roy Marsden as Dalgliesh)."

  "text" : "Michael Melia (born 1945) is an established British actor best known for his work on television. Melia was born in Berkshire and attended St. Mary's College, Twickenham, the oldest Roman Catholic college in England. Before taking up acting he was a teacher. At one stage he ran a bar in Spain and thought about applying for a pub tenancy in England. However the idea was vetoed by his wife, former actress turned teacher, Celia Melia. He began acting in television in the early 1970s, usually playing heavies or policemen, though he spent four years performing classic plays with the National Theatre. He joined the BBC One soap opera EastEnders in 1990 as pub landlord Eddie Royle; however he lasted just over a year in this role as his character was killed off in September 1991 after being stabbed by Nick Cotton (John Altman) who was later tried for the murder but cleared. After leaving EastEnders, he appeared as Frank Dagley on Dangerfield; and, more recently, Jerry Block for over a hundred episodes of the footballing soap opera Dream Team. His rugged features have led to parts in numerous crime dramas: The Sweeney, The Bill, Minder in the Series 1 episode Monday Night Fever, C.A.T.S. Eyes, Campion, The Chinese Detective, Dempsey and Makepeace, Rumpole of the Bailey, Inspector Morse, Maigret, The Detectives, Daylight Robbery and New Tricks. He has also had parts in many other established dramas including When the Boat Comes In, Coronation Street, Casualty and most recently Doctors and Emmerdale. He is also known for having appeared on Doctor Who in full alien costume as the Terileptil Leader in the 1982 story The Visitation; and had a minor part on Blake's 7. He lives in Hampton Wick, Surrey with his wife and pet cat. He has two children, Tom and Charlotte, who have both appeared as extras in the EastEnders market square. More recently, he has appeared in short films, directed by his son Tom, which can be found on their website www.mean-eyedcat.co.uk.His daughter, Charlotte, also stars. In 2010, he guest starred in Dani's House."

She then was a regular in the television series General Hospital playing nurse Katy Shaw and had a small part in The Sweeney. She joined the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1979, where she played principal roles until 1982. Her “memorable...and exceptional” performance of Iphigenia in The Greeks and Juliet in Romeo and Juliet were particularly notable. Time magazine critic T.E. Kalem wrote of her “unforgettable” portrayal of Iphigenia: “...as Buxton reaches the heartbreaking conclusion that the one life she has to give for Hellas is the noblest life to have lived, she radiates a great and unforgettable purity of spirit.” She later worked mainly in television, playing Ruth in the television comedy On the Up, Inga, Roj Blake's cousin in Blake's Seven and Susan Protheroe in 1983's production of By The Sword Divided. In 2006 she was in the cast of a well-received UK touring production of Noël Coward’s Star Quality. She appeared in two series-three episodes of Rising Damp, as Caroline Armitage.

He is a former Shanxi wushu team athlete trained by the coaches Pang Lin Tai and Zhang Ling Mei. He became the standard that other athletes were judged by in the nineties: his personal long fist and staff forms were famously made into the compulsory wushu guiding forms which other athletes had to perform and compete in."
