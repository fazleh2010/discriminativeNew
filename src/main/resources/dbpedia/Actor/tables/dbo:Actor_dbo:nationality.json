At the time of filming for The Barbarian and the Geisha she was 5 feet 7 inches (1.70 m) and weighed 115 pounds (52 kg). When director John Huston was looking for an actress for the part of Okichi, a friend of Ando's who worked in the Tokyo office of 20th Century-Fox recommended Ando to Huston. Once Huston saw her, after auditioning 33 other actresses, he and producer Eugene Frenke were done looking, mainly because of her height over the other women."

In their obituary, the Independent wrote \"Pollock is believed to have played, in a career spanning 72 years, more Shavian heroines than anyone else. She directed London seasons of his plays; and it was during the London premiere of one of his lesser-known works – Farfetched Fables (Watergate, 1950) – that she announced Shaw's death from the stage.\" Pollock's dedication to acting began as a seven-year-old, when she saw Sarah Bernhardt on stage; she knew then that she wanted to be an actress herself. Pollock was also a theatre director and a teacher of drama at RADA and Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art; and her varied television work included several appearances in The Forsyte Saga for the BBC. She outlived both husbands, Captain Leslie Hancock and the artist James Proudfoot. She had one child with Captain Hancock. Pollock was the subject of TV's This Is Your Life in 1992. Ellen Pollock's mother, Hedwig Kahn, was the sister of Otto Hermann Kahn (wealthy investment banker, collector, philanthropist, and patron of the arts) and composer Robert Kahn."

In 1955, with two classmates, he founded the animation studio AB Team Film, which by 1966 made him one of Sweden's best known animators. In 1972 the company produced Agaton Sax och bröderna Max, a television series based on the book of the same name by Nils-Olof Franzén, one of the series about the detective Agaton Sax. In 1976 they produced a series of three short films for television about Agaton Sax, and also Agaton Sax and the Byköpings Village Festival, the first full-length entirely animated Swedish film, co-produced by the Swedish Film Institute. Team Film went on to produce two further full-length animated features, Peter-No-Tail (1981), which was a critical and popular success and was also released in several other countries, and Peter-No-Tail in Americat (1985), which had faster action and for which some of the animation and coloring was outsourced to Prague; it made less money and received a mixed critical reception. Team Film also produced a series for small children, Totte (1973), based on books by Gunilla Wolde, and three shorts based on other children's books, Kattresan (1982), Sjörövarfilmen (1983), and Musikbussen (1994), the first two again sponsored by the Swedish Film Institute. Lasseby also voiced Tänkande August, the computer, in the Agaton Sax films and TV series. Lasseby created an animation school in Eksjö; in 1996 this became the first college-level animation training program in Sweden. He died in 1996 in Hult."

His father was William King Wood (CIE, CBE), Director of the Indo-European Telegraph Department and his mother was Daisy Adcock, daughter of Sir Hugh Adcock (who was once the physician to the Shah of Persia). He studied at Oxford University and was a keen member of OUDS (Oxford University Dramatic Society) appearing in The Radio Times in April 1936 whilst appearing as Richard II. David King-Wood (he apparently added the hyphen) appeared in British television and films during the 1950s. His Broadway credits include Friar Francis in Much Ado About Nothing (1959) and Adam Hartley in The Hidden River (1957). His British theatre credits include Measure for Measure and Richard III for The Old Vic, seasons with the Birmingham Repertory Company, the Oxford Repertory Company and the Worthing Repertory Company and the 1937 season at the Regent's Park Open Air Festival. He was also a regular performer with the Shakespeare Festival. His film credits include The Blakes Slept Here (1953) The Men of Sherwood Forest (1954) The Quatermass Xperiment (1955) and Jamboree (1957) among others. During the Second World War, his fluency in five languages, including Japanese, was used to the fore, but at the expense of his theatrical career. He relocated to New York in the mid-1950s and acted on Broadway for a number of years. David was also the \"it\" male model for a time and was the \"Marlboro Man\" for a couple of years. He ended his professional life teaching English and French at St. Bernard's School in New York, as well as directing the annual Shakespeare Play there. David loved nature, and as an enthusiastic New Yorker, spent many happy hours in Central Park. More than one hundred and fifty of his friends contributed to the David King-Wood Tree Fund, and two European Linden trees have been endowed in his name. There is a paving stone by the Olmsted Flowerbed at Literary Walk, mid-park at Sixty-Seventh Street, as well as the two trees near the East Meadow."
