  "text" : "Race Wong is an actress, singer and businesswoman. Born in Malaysia, raised in Singapore, she pursued her career in the entertainment industry in Hong Kong with her sister Rosanne Wong which won her various awards for her singing career as the cantopop group 2R, including Most Promising Newcomer and Most Popular Group Award in the Annual Top 10 Song of the Year Awards (2003), Metro Broadcasting Music awards (2004), TVB Top 10 Songs of the Year (2004) and Hong Kong Commercial Radio Music Awards’ (2003). Race Wong became a spotlight when she was chosen to star alongside Stephen Chow in his famous annual San Miguel TV advertisement. Following that, she rose to fame for her leading role in a TVB youth series Hearts Of Fencing. Which jumpstarted both her singing and acting career. Race Wong hoped to focus her acting on roles beyond her youthful and sweet appearance. Her outstanding performance in her first leading role in movie Abnormal Beauty Abnormal Beauty won her a nomination for the Best New Actor in the 24th Annual Hong Kong Film Awards (2005) and the 42nd Golden Horse Film Awards’ (2005) in Taiwan. Race Wong continued to experiment with different roles both on-screen and off-screen. In 2006, together with her sister Rosanne Wong, they took on groundbreaking leading roles in a musical adaption of The Smiling Proud Wanderer stage performance by the Hong Kong Dance Company (2006) where Rosanne famously shaved bald for the role. The musical enjoyed a success which brought them to perform in Shanghai the following year. Later in 2008, Race Wong’s starring role as a pregnant new immigrant from China was a break away from her usual youthful image in the movie True Women For Sale which earned her a nomination for Best Supporting Actress in the 28th Hong Kong Film Awards (2009). Race is one of the very rare few Singaporeans to have been nominated in the Hong Kong Film Awards. In 2010, Race Wong decided to step out of the limelight for a break. She took on a Masters of Business course to further her education and graduated with a Masters of Business majoring in Marketing from the University of Newcastle (Australia) in 2013. Concurrently in 2011, she made an unexpected career change into finance, taking on the role of Marketing Manager at Maybank Kim Eng Securities (Hong Kong). She was licensed with the Securities and Futures Commission to conduct equities trading. The year she turned 30, Race Wong made a surprising move to relocate back to Singapore where her family is based. Together with her younger sister Rhonda Wong, she set up Anthill Realtors Pte. Ltd. in 2013 a real estate agency licensed with CEA. She then co-founded Ohmyhome Pte Ltd in 2015, a tech company focused on connecting buyers to sellers, landlords to tenants in real estate. When asked about her career move, Race said that she wanted to focus her attention on something that will provide more value to people, something on the opposite spectrum of her celebrity lifestyle. She speaks fluent Cantonese, Mandarin, and English."

  "text" : "Huang Yu-chun (born 16 November 1939 in Shantou, Republic of China), known by her final stage name Ivy Ling Po, is a retired Hong Kong actress and Chinese opera singer. She is best known for a number of mega-hit Huangmei opera films in the 1960s, especially The Love Eterne (1963) which made her an Asian superstar overnight. She played an important role in the entertainment industry for preserving the Huangmei opera art form. She has used many names in her past. When she was a young child, she was sold to a family in Xiamen (Amoy), where she took on the name Jun Haitang (Chinese: 君海棠; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Kun Hái-tông) and worked as a domestic maid. After reaching preadolescence, her foster mother forced her to enter the Hong Kong movie industry to exploit her. She first acted in Amoy Hokkien films under the stage name Xiaojuan (Chinese: 小娟; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Sió-koan), later in Cantonese films under the stage name Shen Yan (Chinese: 沈雁; Jyutping: Sam2 Ngaan6), before finally entering the Shaw Brothers Studio to act in Mandarin films as (Ivy) Ling Po (Chinese: 凌波; pinyin: Líng Bō) and rising to superstardom."

Lam spent a number of years overseas before returning to Hong Kong to launch his career. Lam was the lead singer for a band called \"Jade\" until he went solo with his first English album \"Lam\" in 1976. His first Cantonese album, having the same name, was also released in the same year. He also recorded two versions of the Billy Joel song \"Uptown Girl\" in Cantonese. Lam has remained popular in Hong Kong for three decades. He writes a number of his own songs; some of them have also been recorded by other singers including Teresa Carpio, with whom he recorded an album and has given joint concerts, most recently in 2007. In addition to his singing career, Lam has also acted in many films, making his film debut in Luckies Trio in 1978. Possibly his most memorable role was as a Japanese journalist in Boat People (1982), directed by Ann Hui."

In 2001, Capital Artists failed in the market, and Leung was left contract-less for over a year. During this time, Leung began composing music and was the leader of William So's concert band, while also learning to play the piano. Under the guidance of Paco Wong, he signed to Gold Typhoon in 2003, being marketed as a singer-songwriter. That same year, he released his first album under Gold Typhoon, Number 10, which won Best Album of the Year at the Ultimate Song Chart awards. Some of his hits include \"Thinking Too Much\" (自作聰明), \"Get Lost/Cheating\" (滾, duet with Miriam Yeung), \"Hey June\", \"Battleship Team\" (艦隊), \"8 Mile Highway\" (八里公路), \"Blooming Flowers in 3000 Years\" (三千年開花), \"Female News Presenter\" (新聞女郎), \"Beatles\" (披頭四), \"501\", \"Seven Friends\" (七友), \"Fresh Start\" (重新做人), \"Madam! Madam!\" (太太！太太！), \"Big Excitement\" (大激想, with Eason Chan and Miriam Yeung), \"Best Friend\" (好朋友), \"A Man in the Closet\" (衣櫃裡的男人), \"Three Wounded Hearts\" (傷了三個心), \"Love and Emotions\" (愛與情), \"Lingering Game\" (纏綿遊戲), and \"Don't Want To Be Alone\" (不願一個人). In 2008, he performed at the S.U.C.C.E.S.S. Charity Gala at Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada with many other artists. He was a co-host of the popular variety show, Beautiful Cooking with Ronald Cheng and Alex Fong."

He has been a fight choreographer for, amongst others, Jackie Chan, King Hu, and John Woo. Hung is one of the pivotal figures who spearheaded the Hong Kong New Wave movement of the 1980s, helped reinvent the martial arts genre and started the vampire-like jiangshi genre. He is widely credited with assisting many of his compatriots, giving them their starts in the Hong Kong film industry, by casting them in the films he produced, or giving them roles in the production crew. It is common for Asians to address their elders or influential people with familial nouns as a sign of familiarity and respect. Jackie Chan, for example, is often addressed as \"Da Goh\" (Chinese: 大哥; pinyin: dà gē), meaning Big Brother. Hung was also known as \"Dai Goh\", until the filming of Project A, which featured both actors. As Hung was the eldest of the kung fu \"brothers\", and the first to make a mark on the industry, he was given the nickname \"Da Goh Da\" (Chinese: 大哥大; pinyin: dà gē dà; Jyutping: daai6 go1 daai6), meaning, Big, Big Brother, or Biggest Big Brother."

  "text" : "(This is a Chinese name; the family name is Lee.) Lee Jun-fan (Chinese: 李振藩; November 27, 1940 – July 20, 1973), known professionally as Bruce Lee, was a Hong Kong and American actor, martial artist, philosopher, filmmaker, and founder of the martial art Jeet Kune Do. Lee was the son of Cantonese opera star Lee Hoi-Chuen. He is widely considered by commentators, critics, media, and other martial artists to be one of the most influential martial artists of all time, and a pop culture icon of the 20th century. He is often credited with helping to change the way Asians were presented in American films. Lee was born in Chinatown, San Francisco on November 27, 1940 to parents from Hong Kong and was raised in Kowloon, Hong Kong with his family until his late teens. He was introduced to the film industry by his father and appeared in several films as a child actor. Lee moved to the United States at the age of 18 to receive his higher education, at the University of Washington, at Seattle and it was during this time that he began teaching martial arts. His Hong Kong and Hollywood-produced films elevated the traditional Hong Kong martial arts film to a new level of popularity and acclaim, sparking a surge of interest in Chinese martial arts in the West in the 1970s. The direction and tone of his films changed and influenced martial arts and martial arts films in the US, Hong Kong and the rest of the world. He is noted for his roles in five feature-length films: Lo Wei's The Big Boss (1971) and Fist of Fury (1972); Golden Harvest's Way of the Dragon (1972), directed and written by Lee; Golden Harvest and Warner Brothers' Enter the Dragon (1973) and The Game of Death (1978), both directed by Robert Clouse. Lee became an iconic figure known throughout the world, particularly among the Chinese, as he portrayed Chinese nationalism in his films. He trained in the art of Wing Chun and later combined his other influences from various sources, in the spirit of his personal martial arts philosophy, which he dubbed Jeet Kune Do (The Way of the Intercepting Fist). Lee held dual nationality of Hong Kong and the US. He died in Kowloon Tong on July 20, 1973 at the age of 32."

At the time of his audition, Hung was a civil engineering student at UC Berkeley. After his spirited audition to be the next American Idol, he inadvertently won the support of many fans. Hung voluntarily left university to pursue a music career. His recording career was marked by constant negative critical reaction, and his fame became the subject of much controversy as both he and his fans were accused of promoting and endorsing racial stereotypes against Asians, as he was perceived to lack musical talent and be celebrated only for embodying these stereotypes. In spite of the criticism and the implications of his success, he only showed signs of thoroughly enjoying his celebrity, believing he was living his dream. He brought his own career as a musician to an end when in 2011 he accepted a job opportunity as a technical crime analyst for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, and decided to pursue law enforcement instead of music. Since then, Hung has reflected positively on his pop music career."

This became a pattern, in that he was cast as the villain in the majority of his movies, with Martial Club being a famous exception. In 1985, Wang moved behind the camera, choreographing fight scenes, writing, and directing many movies such as Hong Kong Godfather. He has recently retired from the industry."

  "text" : "Zhang Yimou (Mandarin pronunciation: [tʂɑ́ŋ îmɤ̌ʊ̯], JONG EE-moe; born 14 November 1951) is a Chinese film director, producer, writer and actor, and former cinematographer. He is counted amongst the Fifth Generation of Chinese filmmakers, having made his directorial debut in 1987 with Red Sorghum. Zhang has won numerous awards and recognitions, with Best Foreign Film nominations for Ju Dou in 1990, Raise the Red Lantern in 1991, and Hero in 2003, Silver Lion and Golden Lion prizes at the Venice Film Festival, Grand Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, and the Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival. In 1993, he was a member of the jury at the 43rd Berlin International Film Festival. Zhang directed the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympic Games, which received considerable international acclaim. One of Zhang's recurrent themes is the resilience of Chinese people in the face of hardship and adversity, a theme which has been explored in such films as, for example, To Live (1994) and Not One Less (1999). His films are particularly noted for their rich use of colour, as can be seen in some of his early films, like Raise the Red Lantern, and in his wuxia films like Hero and House of Flying Daggers. His most recent film is a historical drama film called Coming Home."

  "text" : "(This is a Chinese name; the family name is Cheung.) Leslie Cheung Kwok-wing (12 September 1956 – 1 April 2003) was a Hong Kong singer, actor and film producer. He is considered \"one of the founding fathers of Cantopop\" by \"combining a hugely successful film and music career.\" He rose to prominence as a teen heartthrob and pop icon of Hong Kong in the 1980s, receiving numerous music awards including both Most Popular Male Artist Awards at the 1988 and 1989 Jade Solid Gold Best Ten Music Awards. In 1989, Cheung announced his retirement from the music industry as a pop singer. Returning to the music scene after a five-year hiatus, Cheung released his chart-topping comeback album Most Beloved (寵愛) which achieved a huge market success. In 1999, he won the Golden Needle Award for his outstanding achievement as a musician at the RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards, and his 1984 hit song Monica was voted as Hong Kong's \"Song of the Century\". He was honoured as \"Asia's Biggest Superstar\" at the 2000 CCTV-MTV Music Honours. Cheung won the 1991 Hong Kong Film Award (Days of Being Wild) and the 1994 Hong Kong Film Critics Society Award (Ashes of Time) for best actor. He had also won the 1994 Japan Film Critics Society Award for best actor for his performance in Farewell My Concubine and ten other best actor nominations, five Golden Horse Awards, three Cannes Film Festival Awards, a Asia Pacific Film Festival Award, and a Venice Film Festival Award. Cheung's music and movies not only captured fans in Hong Kong but also other Asian areas including Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, China, Japan and South Korea. He is the first foreign artist to hold 16 concerts in Japan that has yet to be broken and the record holder as the best-selling C-pop artist in Korea. Cheung was ranked as the favourite actor in the 100 years of Chinese cinema. In 2010, he was voted the third \"Most Iconic Musicians of All Time\" (after Michael Jackson and The Beatles). CNN considered Cheung as the \"Most Beautiful Man from Hong Kong Cinema\" and one of \"Asia's 25 Greatest Actors of All Time.\" Cheung committed suicide on April 1, 2003 by jumping off the 24th floor of the Mandarin Oriental hotel in Hong Kong. A suicide note left by Cheung stated that he had been suffering from depression."

Often dubbed the Meryl Streep of MediaCorp and the best actress of her generation, Huang returned to the entertainment industry in 2014 and continues to take on television projects on an ad hoc basis. Huang's performances in her most recent drama serials, Three Wishes and Tiger Mum, garnered largely favourable responses and proved to be hugely popular among viewers. Both dramas hold the title of Top Rated Drama for Years 2014 and 2015 respectively. As a freelance actress without an artiste management contract with the TV station, Huang has been disqualified from contesting in the annual Star Awards in recent years. This has drawn much controversy from the public."

  "text" : "Hsiao Ho, (Hsiao Hou) (Chinese: 小侯; Cantonese: Siu Hau, born 1 January 1958 in Meixian District, Guangdong, China) is a Hong Kong martial arts film actor, stunt performer and action choreographer. A Hakka, he has acted in many films directed by Lau Kar-leung, including Mad Monkey Kung Fu and Legendary Weapons of China. In 1985 he portrayed legendary kung fu warrior Fong Sai-Yuk in the Lau directed action-comedy, Disciples of the 36th Chamber and also took a lead role in Fake Ghost Catchers, directed by Lau Kar Wing. Fake Ghost Catchers is marketed by Celestial Pictures as being made two years before Ghostbusters (inferring that the idea for Ghostbusters may have come from the movie). Hou is also known for portraying the \"disfigured swordsman\" and doubling complicated action scenes in 1993's Iron Monkey. He was also the action director for the movie Shaolin Avengers (1994). In 1982 he was nominated for Best Action Choreography for the movie Legendary Weapons of China (for which he was action director) at the Hong Kong Film Awards alongside Lau Kar Leung and Ching Chu who also provided choreography for the film. Born Hao Yiu Chung, he was trained in Beijing opera by Fan Kuk-Fa as a child and acted in films. He moved to the United States in the 1960s with classmates where he learned acrobatics from different instructors under the watchful tutelage of Fan Kuk-Fa. He later returned to China, and at age 17 became a martial arts stunt performer, which led to his starring role in Mad Monkey Kung Fu in 1979. He then became a contracted actor with Shaw Brothers Studio and studied Hung Gar, a specialised Kung Fu under Lau Kar Leung. A very young man at the time, he was always cast by director Lau Kar Leung as the rebellious teen. In the cult classic My Young Auntie Hou played the energetic rebellious teenage son of Lau Kar Leung. In Disciples of the 36th Chamber he also played the rebellious son. Because of an ability to perform difficult stunts and acrobats with ease, Hsiao Hou was often cast in roles that required an expert stunt performer and martial artist. While his career did not reach the popularity of frequent co-stars Gordon Liu or Kara Hui, he is considered a Shaw Brothers legend by legions of fans and is highly regarded for martial arts, comedic talents, and acrobatic talent. Lau Kar Leung was once quoted as calling Hou the most \"talented action actor (or star)\" in his class. Hsiao Hou's last known interview was in 2004 taken by Video Asia. Though he was not featured on the cover in western versions of the popular Shaw Brother releases, Hsiao Hou took the starring roles in Mad Monkey Kung Fu, Legendary Weapons of China, Disciples of the 36th Chamber, Fake Ghost Catchers and My Young Auntie. He later acted in small supporting roles in films by Sammo Hung. He has also been a martial arts and action director/choreographer."

During her prime years, Mui made major contributions to the Cantopop music scene while receiving numerous awards and honours. She remained an idol throughout most of her career, and was generally regarded as a Cantopop diva. Mui once held a sold-out concert in Hammersmith, London, England, where she was dubbed the \"Madonna of Asia (東方麥當娜)\", which brought her to further international fame. That title stayed with her throughout her career, and has been used as a comparison for both Eastern and Western media. In the 1980s, the gangtai style of music was revolutionised by Mui's wild dancing and on-stage femininity. She was famed for her outrageous costumes and high-power performances in combination with contralto vocals, which are rare in female artists. Her fan base reached far beyond Hong Kong into many parts of Asia, including Taiwan, mainland China, Singapore and Malaysia, and other countries as well. In the Hong Kong entertainment industry, where stars often rise and fall quickly, Mui remained in the spotlight for 21 years (1982–2003). Her career came to a halt abruptly in 2003 when she announced that she had cervical cancer. She died later that year at the age of 40. Mui's continuing commemoration by the Hong Kong entertainment industry was due not only to her music and film legacies, but also her involvement in charity and humanitarian work."

She represented Singapore at the Miss Universe 1994. She quit her job in business development to launch an acting career in Hong Kong. In 1996 she was offered HK$20 million to pose nude and rejected the offer. She was the first female from Singapore to be nominated for a Hong Kong Film Award in 1997 for her role in Island of Greed. In 2000, she was featured in Wong Kar-wai's award-winning film In The Mood For Love but most of her scenes were not put into the final cut. She has worked in many commercials for ATV and beauty products in an effort to further advance her career. She is lesser known than her acting peers in Hong Kong despite her efforts. She can fluently speak English, Cantonese, Mandarin and Japanese and has used all four languages in her roles. Sun has said her nickname \"Alien Sun\" was given to her by classmates in school who made fun of her for having a head that was slightly disproportionately larger than her body during childhood."

As a result, Chan was adopted by Chan Fei-nung and his wife, Kung Fan-hung, who were renowned Cantonese opera stars. During the 1960s, Connie Chan was one of Hong Kong cinema's most beloved teen idols. She made more than 230 films in a variety of genres: from traditional Cantonese opera and wuxia movies to contemporary youth musicals; action films to comedies; melodramas and romances. Owing to her popularity she was dubbed \"The Movie-Fan Princess\". Her godfather is actor Cho Tat Wah. She has a son named Dexter Yeung, who stars in the 2008 TVB Series Wasabi Mon Amour and Moonlight Resonance."

  "text" : "(This is a Chinese name; the family name is Wong.) Dayo Wong Tze-wah (born 5 September 1960) is a Hong Kong stand-up comedian, actor, presenter, screenwriter, and singer, who is the pioneer of stand-up comedy in Hong Kong. Wong gained a degree in philosophy from the University of Alberta in Canada. He began his career in the entertainment industry in Hong Kong in 1984, but he is best known for his works in live stand-up comedy which he started performing regularly since 1990. Since then he has starred in TV dramas and films, and recorded his own album. Dayo had his TVB TV series debut in 1999, acting as \"Lai Sam\" in \"Justice Sung 2\". A year later, he reached a milestone of his TV series career. Dayo as a lazy office assistant in a law firm in War of the Gender, winning the My Favourite Television Character Award in 2002. It is when his flame reached his highest point. 2004 was a fruitful year for Dayo as it was when he won two awards: the My Favourite On-Screen Partners (with Ada Choi in \"Catch the Uncatchable\") and again, the My Favourite Television Character Award (also in \"Catch the Uncatchable\"). He was so close to the \"TV King\" Award (The Best Actor Award). He was on the nomination list of the award in both 2007 and 2009. He was finally crowned as TV King with \"Bounty Lady\" in 2013. To Dayo, the award was an accumulative result of his TVB dramas. He also revealed that his relationship with Chilam were like cousins. In that year, Chilam Cheung started as the clear favourite of the audience due to his absolute popularity starring as Captain Cool in \"Triumph in the Skies 2\". Though Chilam ended up winning the Most Popular Male Character, he sounded disappointed in his acceptance speech (the price is widely recognised as a consolation prize to The Best Actor Award). Chilam did not stay behind the ceremony for the TVB official interview. He explained that he was not informed to stay behind for any interview. The discord rumours between Chilam and Dayo begin to spread out widely. However, the rumour was shot down when Chilam surprised Dayo by his sudden appearance at a meal gathering of the Bounty Lady. Besides the TVB drama career, Dayo is also well known to be a stand-up comedian. He introduced stand up comedy to Hong Kong. He has done thirteen stand up comedy routines so far, mainly targeting local Hong Kongnese. Unlike Northern American stand-up comedians, his jokes usually includes a lot of political and philosophical content, which brings up a high level of consonant among audience. \"Hong Kong's housing issue is absolutely ridiculous. I have discussed this in my stand-up shows too. Hong Kong residents need to have 13 to 14 times their current annual salary to finally be qualified for home ownership.\" said the comedian. Up to 2013, he has done as much as thirteen shows. Seven of them were also performed in Australia, Canada and the United States. Dayo's latest talk show was performed on October 2014. A month later, the show was brought to Canada and the United States as well. In comparison with his stand-up comedy and TV dramas, his movies are not as successful. When being asked the reasons behind, he explained that his ultimate goal is to look for something new in his movies. His visions makes his work good to watch, but it is not good enough to attract people to pay for a cinema ticket. The second reason is that he hates doing promotion for his work."

  "text" : "Faye Wong (born 8 August 1969) is a Chinese singer-songwriter and actress, often referred to as a \"diva\" (Chinese: 天后; literally: \"Heavenly Queen\") in Chinese-language media. Early in her career she briefly used the stage name Shirley Wong. Born in Beijing, she moved to British Hong Kong in 1987 and came to public attention in the early 1990s by singing ballads in Cantonese. Since 1994 she has recorded mostly in her native Mandarin, often combining alternative music with mainstream Chinese pop. In 2000 she was recognised by Guinness World Records as the Best Selling Canto-Pop Female. Following her second marriage in 2005 she withdrew from the limelight, but returned to the stage in 2010 amidst immense interest in the Sinophone world. Hugely popular in Mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore, she has also gained a large following in Japan. In the West she is perhaps best known for starring in Wong Kar-wai's films Chungking Express and 2046. While she has collaborated with international artists such as Cocteau Twins, Wong recorded only a few songs in English, including \"Eyes on Me\" – the theme song of the video game Final Fantasy VIII. Wong is known to be reserved in public, and has gained a reputation for her \"coolness\". In Encyclopedia of Contemporary Chinese Culture, Jeroen de Kloet characterised her as \"singer, actress, mother, celebrity, royalty, sex symbol and diva all at the same time\"."

She was also the youngest actress to have earned an All-Time Favourite Award at the Star Awards. In late 2002, Fann became attached to Malaysian actor Christopher Lee, with whom she has collaborated eight times. She married Lee on 29 September 2009. She is known to zealously safeguard her privacy."

Tan Sri Dato' Seri Michelle Yeoh Choo-Kheng (born 6 August 1962) is a Chinese-Malaysian actress, best known for performing her own stunts in the Hong Kong action films that brought her to fame in the early 1990s. Born in Ipoh, Malaysia, she was chosen by People as one of the \"50 Most Beautiful People in the World\" in 1997. She is best known in the Western world for her roles in the 1997 James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies, playing Wai Lin, and the multiple Academy Award–winning Chinese-language martial arts film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, for which she was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in 2000. In 2008, the film critic website Rotten Tomatoes ranked her the greatest action heroine of all time. In 2009, she was listed by People magazine – as the only Asian actress – as one of the \"35 All-Time Screen Beauties\". She is credited as Michelle Khan in some of her earlier films. This alias was chosen by the D&B studio who thought it might be more marketable to international and western audiences. Yeoh later preferred using her real name."

  "text" : "Michael Audreson (born 1 August 1956) is a British actor who appeared in many films and television shows in the 1960s. He appeared in the 12-episode Children's Film Foundation series The Magnificent Six and a Half before playing the bespectacled \"Brains\" in Here Come the Double Deckers (1970–71). In the film Young Winston (1971) he played Winston Churchill as a schoolboy. As the 1970s progressed, Audreson's appearances reduced significantly, but he had a role in two episodes of The Tomorrow People (1978) television series. In 1996 he founded Rivendell Healthcare, a drug and alcohol addiction treatment centre. Audreson wrote and directed two short films: The Man Who Could Read Minds (1999) and Eve Buckingham (2001) starring Susan Hampshire. His feature film The 10 Arenas of Marwood (2010), which he wrote and directed, starred Judi Bowker, John Hasler, Kate G. Laycy, Michael Mayne, Bryan Murray, Lucy Russell, Issy Van Randwyck, Emma Williams and Peter Wickham as Marwood. In 2015, he founded a media production and distribution company, 10am Transmedia, which specialises in Transmedia storytelling. Its first project is called Don't Get Mad."

  "text" : "Margaret Lacey  (15 February 1910 – 4 October 1989) was a Welsh actress and ballet teacher. She lived in retirement at Wern, in the snowdonia village of Rowen, Conwy. She appeared in over 30 films between 1957 and 1985 mostly playing a sweet old lady or motherly figure in minor roles. She is perhaps best remembered internationally for starring in the 1971 James Bond film Diamonds Are Forever in which she played a seemingly innocent Christian school teacher who smuggled diamonds in her bible for the henchmen Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd. In the film, she was later found murdered and her body recovered out of an Amsterdam canal. She also had cameo role in John Schlesinger's 1961 semi-documentary \"Terminus\" as the elderly lady who lost her umbrella. She was friendly with Schlesinger and appeared in small parts in several of his films. For some years in the 1950s and 1960s she held regular dancing classes at the former Metropole Hotel in Colwyn Bay. Lacey also made appearances in Dr Finlays Casebook (1960s), Z-Cars and her last credited appearance was in Magnum, P.I. in 1985."

Meilin first appeared on Chinese national and worldwide television in 2006 with her younger sister, Suelin, winning first place on Beijing Television’s ‘Arts of Our Land’ competition, performing a traditional Chinese ‘hulusi’ flute duet. BTV’s Arts of Our Land competition (Wai Guo Ren Zhong Hua Cai Yi Da Sai), was China’s then-premier international competition for foreigners to showcase their talents in traditional Chinese art and culture. Following success on BTV’s ‘Arts of Our Land’, Meilin entered China Central Television’s ‘Xing Guang Da Dao’ Star Search competition, China’s foremost national talent competition, where she won first place in both the weekly and monthly competitions. In 2007, Meilin (梅琳) and Hong Kong singer and actor, Nicholas Tse, recorded the theme song and music video for Walt Disney’s Mandarin language release of the film ‘Beauty and the Beast’, which gave Meilin her first commercial success, with the song reaching No.2 on Pepsi’s Chinese Billboard Pop Charts."

  "text" : "Jia Hongsheng (simplified Chinese: 贾宏声; traditional Chinese: 賈宏聲; pinyin: Jiǎ Hóngshēng; 19 March 1967 – 5 July 2010) was a Chinese actor who became known in the late 1980s and early 1990s for roles in movies like The Case of the Silver Snake (1988), Good Morning, Beijing (1991), A Woman from North Shaanxi (1993) and Weekend Lover (1995). His performances were praised by critics and he developed a rebellious image that made him popular among artistic youth and the \"Sixth Generation\" of Chinese directors. However, he backed away from the limelight in 1995 after becoming addicted to cannabis and eventually heroin. His father, head of the local theatre in Jilin, retired two years before his retirement age, and along with his wife moved to Beijing to try to help Jia. He made a comeback in 2000, starring in the celebrated Suzhou River. The following year he starred in the film he is best known for to Western audiences, the autobiographical Quitting. It depicts his battle with addiction and his family trying to help him sober up, with all of the cast members being real people playing themselves."

This allowed her to represent China in Japanese propaganda movies. After the war, she appeared in Japanese movies under her real name, as well as in several English-language movies under the stage name Shirley Yamaguchi. She was elected as a member of the Japanese parliament in the 1970s and served for 18 years. After retiring from politics, she served as vice president of the Asian Women's Fund."

  "text" : "Yam Kim Fai (Chinese: 任劍輝, 4 February 1913 (Lunar 29 December 1912) – 29 November 1989), also known as Ren Jianhui was a renowned Cantonese opera actress in China and Hong Kong. She was most notable for her unique ability to sing in the lower register. That her opera voice was indistinguishable from a male one allowed her to play either male or female roles, though she usually performed male ones. Miss Universe 1976, the 25th Miss Universe pageant, was held on 11 July 1976 at the Lee Theatre in Hong Kong. From five portraits, contestants were asked to pick one that she/they could identify, as the only actress instead of an actor, in Cantonese opera costume. Yam was not the one she/they picked. In 1972, TV viewers looked for the \"man\" they knew from movies/stage performances when Yam performed the last time in public. They did not expect to see her in a 2-piece set of jacket and qipao (cheongsam) with floral print. Since 1972, Yam enjoyed singing in private with a live band and was often accompanied by her protégée Loong who would read the lyrics out for her until her eyesight improved with surgery."

  "text" : "Yang Lina (Chinese: 杨莉娜, born 1962 or 1963—died March 20, 2010), also known as Lina Yang, was a Singaporean actress whose credits included dramas such as Samsui Women and An Ode To Life. She was often cast as conniving, plotting characters. Yang became an actress in 1984 after previously working as a bank employee. She had attended an acting class with her sister, actress Yang Libing, and then joined the Singapore Broadcasting Corporation, which is now part of MediaCorp. Her most well known roles included the 1986 film, Neighbours, and Samsui Women. She married her husband, a make-up artist, in 1992. She took two professional breaks from acting to give birth to her two daughters. Yang opened a hair salon with her sister in 2004. She was diagnosed with uterine cancer during the late 2000s, but continued to act sporadically. Her last role was in the second season of Perfect Cut, in which she portrayed a wealthy, lonely woman who was dying from AIDS. She died of cancer in the home of her younger sister, Yang Libing, on March 20, 2010. Her age was unknown. She is survived by her husband, two daughters and sister."
