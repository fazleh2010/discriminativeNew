This included a two-person production with Sladen in Mooney and his Caravans. A notable TV appearance was Miller playing the husband of Sladen in the ITV drama Send In The Girls. Miller and their daughter, Sadie Miller, performed with Sladen in a number of Sarah Jane Smith audio plays, released by Big Finish Productions.
