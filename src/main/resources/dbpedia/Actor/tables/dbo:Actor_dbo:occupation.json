Cowley was in the c. 1591 production of The Seven Deadly Sins, performed by personnel from the Admiral's Men and Lord Strange's Men — a production that included Richard Burbage and other future King's Men. Cowley acted seven minor roles in that production. He also toured with some of the same personnel under Edward Alleyn in 1593. He is thought to have been an original shareholder in the Lord Chamberlain's Men when they re-formed in 1594; but little is known about his career, except for the fact that he played Verges in Much Ado About Nothing, along with William Kempe as Dogberry. For some reason he is not in the cast lists on the three Ben Jonson plays acted by the company in 1598–1603; but he is still one of the sharers when the company is chartered as the King's Men in 1603, and he receives a bequest in the 1605 will of Augustine Phillips. He is known to have married and had four children; two died young. His wife Elizabeth was buried on 28 September 1616 and his own burial followed on 12 March 1619. His will was witnessed by Cuthbert Burbage, John Heminges, Thomas Ravenscroft, and John Shank."

During the 1980s he starred in several successful television series, including Woodentop, Grange Hill and the BBC soap opera EastEnders, where he played Barry Clark from 1986-89. He originally auditioned for the role of Mark Fowler when the series began in 1985, but the role went to David Scarboro instead. Hailes' character was notable for being one half of the soap's first gay couple, introduced as the partner of the yuppie graphic designer, Colin Russell (played by Michael Cashman). In 1987 Hailes' character caused a great deal of controversy after EastEnders screened the first male-to-male kiss on a UK, prime time soap. The kiss prompted a multitude of complaints from angry viewers and a hostile backlash from the right wing press. Despite the fact that Hailes is heterosexual, he suffered from severe homophobia because of the homosexual role he played in EastEnders. He was attacked several times by members of the public who couldn't separate fact from fiction, which included being assaulted in a supermarket by a disapproving woman and strangled by a man at a petrol station. Even after he left the show he lost a job as a children's television presenter because of the so-called \"gay tag\". Since leaving EastEnders in 1989, he has gone on to appear in films such as The Killing Zone (1999); Murder with Mirrors and Waiting for a Killer. On television he has appeared in ITV police drama The Bill (2001–02); Horizon; Nobody’s Hero; Sorry and the BBC’s production of Pinocchio. Theatre appearances include Strip Poker; Doctor on the Boil; Gollocks and numerous pantomimes. He has also performed several plays for BBC radio and voice-overs and had a regular slot \"Hailes Horrors\" on the Steve Allen show on LBC radio. As well as acting, Hailes also drives a London taxi."

A devotee of Bernard Shaw, she was president of the Shaw Society from 1949. In their obituary, the Independent wrote \"Pollock is believed to have played, in a career spanning 72 years, more Shavian heroines than anyone else. She directed London seasons of his plays; and it was during the London premiere of one of his lesser-known works – Farfetched Fables (Watergate, 1950) – that she announced Shaw's death from the stage.\" Pollock's dedication to acting began as a seven-year-old, when she saw Sarah Bernhardt on stage; she knew then that she wanted to be an actress herself. Pollock was also a theatre director and a teacher of drama at RADA and Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art; and her varied television work included several appearances in The Forsyte Saga for the BBC. She outlived both husbands, Captain Leslie Hancock and the artist James Proudfoot. She had one child with Captain Hancock. Pollock was the subject of TV's This Is Your Life in 1992. Ellen Pollock's mother, Hedwig Kahn, was the sister of Otto Hermann Kahn (wealthy investment banker, collector, philanthropist, and patron of the arts) and composer Robert Kahn."

  "text" : "Simon Lack (19 December 1913 – 8 August 1980) was a Scottish actor, working mostly in England. He was born Alexander MacAlpine, in Cleland, Lanarkshire, Scotland. Known locally as Alec, he was the youngest child and only son of his father, Alexander McAlpine (known as Sandy) and his mother Euphemia Ritchie. His sisters were Charlotte (Lottie), Mary, Euphemia (Euphie), Agnes (Nan) and Jenny. Another sister, Jessie, died in childhood. Sandy McAlpine was a stonemason, but worked down the mines when there was no masonry work available, making Simon Lack's later role in Proud Valley particularly poignant to those who knew him from his youth. Euphemia Ritchie's family were somewhat wealthier, but she was disowned on account of her choice of husband, and the family lived for many years in a one-room flat (known in Scottish working class language as a 'single end'), although it seems eventually one of her uncles relented and came to their aid. Alec's earliest ventures into acting were in local theatres. He seems to have chosen the pseudonym Simon Lack when he embarked upon the London stage. He lost five years during the Second World War (as did so many British actors). He served in the European theatre, and was present at Monte Cassino. After the war he returned to acting, getting back into stage work. He was also a member of the BBC Radio company during the late 1950s/early 1960s, and notably guest-starred in all but two of the Paul Temple serials (mysteries) that starred Peter Coke and Marjorie Westbury. His television roles included two Doctor Who serials; The Mind of Evil (1971) and The Androids of Tara (1978). He also guest-starred in episodes of The Saint, Jason King, and Doomwatch. He had co-starring roles in Telford's Change, Enemy at the Door and The Borgias."

In 1960 he starred in the BBC's production of An Age of Kings, playing King Henry VI in several episodes. Other notable roles for Scully were as Horatio Nelson in the 1968 television series, Triton, and as Bicket in the BBC's 1967 blockbuster adaptation of The Forsyte Saga. He also appeared in Dixon of Dock Green, Z-Cars, Softly, Softly, Callan, Public Eye, The Venturers, and Angels. Like many actors of his generation, he is now probably best remembered for his roles in Cult TV series, due to their enduring appeal - even though they were no more notable, at the time, than his many other TV roles. He appeared in the Doctor Who serial The Seeds of Death, the Blake's 7 episode \"Dawn of the Gods\" and starred as Vic Thatcher in four episodes of the 1970s series Survivors. During his time on that series, Scully suffered a nervous breakdown. As a result, his role was filled by actor Hugh Walters in subsequent episodes. In 2001 he died of a stroke, aged 68."

This included a two-person production with Sladen in Mooney and his Caravans. A notable TV appearance was Miller playing the husband of Sladen in the ITV drama Send In The Girls. Miller and their daughter, Sadie Miller, performed with Sladen in a number of Sarah Jane Smith audio plays, released by Big Finish Productions.

  "text" : "Ben Holden Driver Warriss (29 May 1909 – 14 January 1993), known as Ben Warriss, was an English comedian and the first cousin of fellow comedy actor Jimmy Jewel. Allegedly the two cousins were born in the same bed (at different times) and brought up in the same household at 52 Andover Street, Sheffield. He was the son of Benjamin Holden Joseph Warriss, an insurance company inspector, and his wife, Mary Ann, née Driver, Jewel's mother's sister. He first performed on the stage in 1930. Jimmy Jewel and Ben Warriss came together as professionals in 1934 at the Palace Theatre, Newcastle. Their double act achieved seven Royal Variety Performances, 12 Blackpool summer seasons, a successful radio series (Up the Pole) and a film of the series. Around 1966, the two went their separate ways, with Warriss performing on stage and Jewel moving into television. In the 1970s Warriss was the resident compere at the Cala Gran club in Fleetwood, Lancashire. In 1988 he played the Emperor of China in the first of the newly reopened Hackney Empire pantomimes, Aladdin. He was still performing in pantomime in his eighties. The character Parker from the 1960s TV series of Thunderbirds is said to have been based upon Warriss' appearance. His first wife, whom he married on 22 September 1934, was Grace Mary Skinner (b. 1910-11), a dancer and teacher of dancing and daughter of Henry Arthur James Skinner, master mariner. This marriage had ended by about 1940 and two years later Warriss married the entertainer Meggie Easton. His third marriage, which took place about 1960, was to Virginia Vernon. He died in 1993 at Brinsworth House, Staines Road, Twickenham, and is buried in the same section of Streatham Park Cemetery, London, as comedian Will Hay."

  "text" : "Hugh Sinclair (19 May 1903 – 29 December 1962) was a British actor born in London, England, the son of a clergyman. He was educated at Charterhouse School and a graduate of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. His first marriage was to the actress Valerie Taylor. In his book The Stage Struck Me! fellow actor Neville Phillips felt Sinclair always played variations of himself, handsome, debonair, suave and witty and excelled in light comedy. By contrast Phillips felt his wife, who Sinclair often appeared opposite, was a dramatic actress of tremendous power with a magnificent voice. Sinclair appeared both on Broadway and on the West End. His screen work began in British films. His most notable role possibly is Leslie Charteris' The Saint in The Saint's Vacation followed by The Saint Meets the Tiger. Sinclair died in Slapton, England at the age of 59."

  "text" : "Avis Bunnage (22 April 1923, Ardwick, Manchester, Lancashire – 4 October 1990, Thorpe Bay, Southend-on-Sea, Essex) was an English actress of film, stage and television. She attended Manley Park Municipal School and Chorlton Central School in Manchester. She worked as a secretary and a nursery teacher before deciding to become an actress. She gained stage experience in rep and made her first professional appearance at Chorlton Rep Theatre in Manchester in 1947. She appeared as Veronica, the wife of Rigsby, in Rising Damp, for one episode, and as Amy Jenkinson, Ivy Unsworth's friend, in 11 episodes of In Loving Memory. Bunnage was a member of Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop company at the Theatre Royal Stratford East. There she created the role of Helen, the mother in A Taste of Honey, her first West End role when the play transferred to Wyndham's Theatre, and also a role in Oh, What a Lovely War! at Stratford East, which also transferred to Wyndham's Theatre. When Avis was on holiday from this production for two weeks, her role was taken over by Danny La Rue. Among her other roles for Theatre Workshop were Mrs. Lovitt in Christopher Bond's play Sweeney Todd (the basis for the Sondheim musical), and the title role in a play about the music hall legend Marie Lloyd. In the early years of Coronation Street she played Lucile Hewitt's auntie. She was in the musical Billy at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, playing the mother of 'Billy Liar'. She played Golda in Fiddler on the Roof, opposite Alfie Bass, at Her Majesty's Theatre in London. Among her various film roles were several British New Wave productions, Saturday Night and Sunday Morning and The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner. Married to Derek Orchard, she died on 4 October 1990 in Thorpe Bay, Southend-on-Sea, Essex, aged 67."

She later worked for the BBC as a radio interviewer, before appearing in London's West End.

Coffey has had a few supporting film roles. These have included Sidonia in Waltz of the Toreadors (1962), Peg in Georgy Girl (1966), Soberness in Far from the Madding Crowd (1967), and Mrs. E in Vivian Stanshall's Sir Henry at Rawlinson End (1980).

  "text" : "Michael Melia (born 1945) is an established British actor best known for his work on television. Melia was born in Berkshire and attended St. Mary's College, Twickenham, the oldest Roman Catholic college in England. Before taking up acting he was a teacher. At one stage he ran a bar in Spain and thought about applying for a pub tenancy in England. However the idea was vetoed by his wife, former actress turned teacher, Celia Melia. He began acting in television in the early 1970s, usually playing heavies or policemen, though he spent four years performing classic plays with the National Theatre. He joined the BBC One soap opera EastEnders in 1990 as pub landlord Eddie Royle; however he lasted just over a year in this role as his character was killed off in September 1991 after being stabbed by Nick Cotton (John Altman) who was later tried for the murder but cleared. After leaving EastEnders, he appeared as Frank Dagley on Dangerfield; and, more recently, Jerry Block for over a hundred episodes of the footballing soap opera Dream Team. His rugged features have led to parts in numerous crime dramas: The Sweeney, The Bill, Minder in the Series 1 episode Monday Night Fever, C.A.T.S. Eyes, Campion, The Chinese Detective, Dempsey and Makepeace, Rumpole of the Bailey, Inspector Morse, Maigret, The Detectives, Daylight Robbery and New Tricks. He has also had parts in many other established dramas including When the Boat Comes In, Coronation Street, Casualty and most recently Doctors and Emmerdale. He is also known for having appeared on Doctor Who in full alien costume as the Terileptil Leader in the 1982 story The Visitation; and had a minor part on Blake's 7. He lives in Hampton Wick, Surrey with his wife and pet cat. He has two children, Tom and Charlotte, who have both appeared as extras in the EastEnders market square. More recently, he has appeared in short films, directed by his son Tom, which can be found on their website www.mean-eyedcat.co.uk.His daughter, Charlotte, also stars. In 2010, he guest starred in Dani's House."

  "text" : "Marlo Lewis (September 15, 1915 – June 8, 1993) was an American executive producer of variety and comedy shows for CBS and is well known for co-producing the famous Ed Sullivan Show. Lewis was the son of a concert pianist and an opera singer. In the mid-1940s he became an executive of the Blaine Thompson Advertising agency, where he created and produced, together with his wife, Mina Bess, the daily radio talk show Luncheon at Sardi's. In 1948 Lewis co-created the Toast of the Town program with Ed Sullivan. In 1955, the TV classic was renamed The Ed Sullivan Show. Together with Sullivan, Lewis personally set the appearance time of each act for the show. In 1956, Elvis Presley appeared on the show, but he was censored because the rumor had it that the rock'n'roll singer had been \"hanging a small soft-drink bottle from his groin underneath his pants, and when he wiggles his leg it looks as though his pecker reaches down to his knee!\" Therefore, Lewis and Sullivan decided to shoot the singer only from the waist up during his TV performance. Apart from this show, Lewis also helped to launch The Jackie Gleason Show, The Dinah Shore Show and The Phil Silvers Show. After 12 years, he left the Sullivan Show in order to set up an independent production company. One of his first projects was the ballet The Nutcracker for an ABC Christmas special in 1961. In the mid-1960s, he produced several musical specials for Perry Como. In 1967, Lewis joined the Norman, Craig & Kummel agency and was elected vice chairman a year later. In 1979, he published, together with his wife, a book entitled Prime Time which includes many backstage stories from the author's times as a producer. Lewis was also a founder of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. Both Lewis and Sullivan shared the George Foster Peabody Award for humanitarian activities. In 1992, Lewis was elected to the Television Producers Hall of Fame. In 1993, he died of heart failure at his a hospital in Palm Springs, California. He is survived by his wife and two children."
