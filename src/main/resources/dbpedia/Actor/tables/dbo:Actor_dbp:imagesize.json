  "text" : "Michael Seymour Langham (22 August 1919 – 15 January 2011) was an English director and actor, who spent much of his career living and working in Canada and the United States. He was educated at Radley College and studied law at the University of London before enlisting in the British Army in 1939. After spending five years as a prisoner of war, Langham set his sights on the theatre and led several repertory theatres in the U.K. including Coventry (1946–48), Birmingham (1948–50) and Glasgow (1953–54). He was the second artistic director at the Stratford Festival in Canada from 1956 to 1967, and the third artistic director of the Guthrie Theater from 1971 to 1977. He was also director of the Juilliard School from 1979 to 1982, and again from 1987 to 1992. Langham's association with the Stratford Festival lasted over a half century as he directed Love's Labours Lost and There Reigns Love for the 2008 season. In 1995 he directed two plays for the inaugural season of the Atlantic Theatre Festival in Wolfville, Nova Scotia. Langham was married to actress Helen Burns. Their son is the writer, actor and comedian Chris Langham. Langham died on 15 January 2011 in Cranbrook, Kent, England after a short illness."

Previously known for his explosive speed and power, he won numerous national and international competitions in the eighties and early nineties, including the first Asian Games in 1990. He is considered by many as a bridge between traditional Chinese martial arts and modern wushu for his successful integration of traditional and modern techniques at a level of fluidity, technique, and explosiveness that had not been seen before, and which has yet to have been matched today. He is a former Shanxi wushu team athlete trained by the coaches Pang Lin Tai and Zhang Ling Mei. He became the standard that other athletes were judged by in the nineties: his personal long fist and staff forms were famously made into the compulsory wushu guiding forms which other athletes had to perform and compete in."
