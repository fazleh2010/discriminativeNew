  "text" : "Margaret Lacey  (15 February 1910 â€“ 4 October 1989) was a Welsh actress and ballet teacher. She lived in retirement at Wern, in the snowdonia village of Rowen, Conwy. She appeared in over 30 films between 1957 and 1985 mostly playing a sweet old lady or motherly figure in minor roles. She is perhaps best remembered internationally for starring in the 1971 James Bond film Diamonds Are Forever in which she played a seemingly innocent Christian school teacher who smuggled diamonds in her bible for the henchmen Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd. In the film, she was later found murdered and her body recovered out of an Amsterdam canal. She also had cameo role in John Schlesinger's 1961 semi-documentary \"Terminus\" as the elderly lady who lost her umbrella. She was friendly with Schlesinger and appeared in small parts in several of his films. For some years in the 1950s and 1960s she held regular dancing classes at the former Metropole Hotel in Colwyn Bay. Lacey also made appearances in Dr Finlays Casebook (1960s), Z-Cars and her last credited appearance was in Magnum, P.I. in 1985."
