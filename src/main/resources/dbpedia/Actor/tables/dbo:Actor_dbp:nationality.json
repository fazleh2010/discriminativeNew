Patricia Brake is arguably best known for her performance as Ingrid Fletcher, the daughter of Norman Stanley Fletcher, in the BBC sitcom Porridge, and its sequel Going Straight. Most recently, in 2015, she guest-starred in the BBC ongoing drama Casualty and in Midsomer Murders for ITV. Alongside her extensive body of work in West End theatres, she has not only appeared as major characters in all the UK soaps, such as Viv Baldwin in ITV's Coronation Street, but has played opposite many British comic actors in numerous situation comedies and one-off plays. After leaving The Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, Patricia's first acting roles were with The Royal Shakespeare Company where she played alongside the likes of Judi Dench, Diana Rigg, Ian Richardson and Ian Holm. Television soon beckoned with performances in iconic series such as Emergency Ward 10 and Lorna Doone, as well as film roles in My Lover, My Son (1970) and The Optimists of Nine Elms (1973). Patricia's substantial career has spanned film, television, theatre and radio, and her charitable work includes the role of Trustee of The Actors' Children's Trust"
