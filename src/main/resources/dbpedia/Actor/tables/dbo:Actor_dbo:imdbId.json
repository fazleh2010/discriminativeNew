During the 1980s he starred in several successful television series, including Woodentop, Grange Hill and the BBC soap opera EastEnders, where he played Barry Clark from 1986-89. He originally auditioned for the role of Mark Fowler when the series began in 1985, but the role went to David Scarboro instead. Hailes' character was notable for being one half of the soap's first gay couple, introduced as the partner of the yuppie graphic designer, Colin Russell (played by Michael Cashman). In 1987 Hailes' character caused a great deal of controversy after EastEnders screened the first male-to-male kiss on a UK, prime time soap. The kiss prompted a multitude of complaints from angry viewers and a hostile backlash from the right wing press. Despite the fact that Hailes is heterosexual, he suffered from severe homophobia because of the homosexual role he played in EastEnders. He was attacked several times by members of the public who couldn't separate fact from fiction, which included being assaulted in a supermarket by a disapproving woman and strangled by a man at a petrol station. Even after he left the show he lost a job as a children's television presenter because of the so-called \"gay tag\". Since leaving EastEnders in 1989, he has gone on to appear in films such as The Killing Zone (1999); Murder with Mirrors and Waiting for a Killer. On television he has appeared in ITV police drama The Bill (2001–02); Horizon; Nobody’s Hero; Sorry and the BBC’s production of Pinocchio. Theatre appearances include Strip Poker; Doctor on the Boil; Gollocks and numerous pantomimes. He has also performed several plays for BBC radio and voice-overs and had a regular slot \"Hailes Horrors\" on the Steve Allen show on LBC radio. As well as acting, Hailes also drives a London taxi."

  "text" : "Keith Jayne (born 10 December 1960) is a British actor, known for playing the title role in the 1981 television adaptation Stig of the Dump. A slow growth rate, due to a pituitary gland problem, made Keith a target of bullies at grammar school. To escape them, he enrolled with The Barbara Speake Stage School. Early roles were in Rumpole of the Bailey, Angels and a variety of Children's Film Foundation productions, including Robin Hood Junior (1975), The Glitterball (1977) and Sammy's Super T-Shirt (1978).In 1974, Keith appeared as Wilfred Schoenfeld in an episode of Upstairs, Downstairs, entitled \"The Beastly Hun\". In 1975, he played Mick in Survivors. However, his big break happened in 1979 when he was cast as Tom Arnold, a cabin boy, in The Onedin Line. This was followed by the lead role in Thames Television’s, BAFTA award nominated, adaptation of Stig of The Dump - which 'is probably the part I am most remembered for'. Keith went on to play 'Boxer Reed' in all 54 episodes of Central TV's kid’s drama, Murphy's Mob. His appearance as Will Chandler - 'one of the most convincing and memorable companions The Doctor never had' – in Doctor Who serial The Awakening, led producer John Nathan-Turner to briefly consider making Keith a series regular. Typecasting (often as a yokel) persuaded Keith to study for a certificate in Finance and Investment. This coincided with a dark period his life, when his earlier health problems came back to haunt him. 'As a result of the growth hormone treatment I received as a child, I received a letter from the NHS saying I may have contracted CJD.' Keith’s high profile saw him interviewed on ITN, a broadcast that curtailed his acting career. 'The fact that it was reported that I was dying did not help me get any further work as no casting director is going to employ you if there is a chance you will keel over before episode two.' Having run a financial services business for the last 22 years, Keith is planning on a return to acting. Looking for an agent he has already made a brief return to television, as a guest in the 'Blast From The Past' section of The Justin Lee Collins Show."

By contrast Phillips felt his wife, who Sinclair often appeared opposite, was a dramatic actress of tremendous power with a magnificent voice. Sinclair appeared both on Broadway and on the West End. His screen work began in British films. His most notable role possibly is Leslie Charteris' The Saint in The Saint's Vacation followed by The Saint Meets the Tiger.

  "text" : "Antonia de Sancha (born 14 September 1961 in Hammersmith, London) is an English actress and businesswoman best known as the former mistress of British Conservative Member of Parliament and Cabinet minister David Mellor which became public knowledge in 1992. She is the daughter of a Spanish film producer father, who died in the mid-1980s, and a Swedish mother who, suffering from severe depression, committed suicide 18 months later, shortly before her daughter began studies at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. At the time of the revelations of her affair, de Sancha was described by some news outlets as a \"soft-porn actress\" because she had played the part of a prostitute in a film in which she had simulated sex. The film \"The Pieman\" also featured John Hemming-Clark, leader of political party Independents to Save Queen Mary's Hospital, as de Sancha's husband. Although \"The Pieman\" has never been on general release, an account of the plot can be found in Hemming-Clark's book, In You Go! A year or two in the life of a scout leader. The affair with Mellor was a contributory factor in his subsequent resignation from the cabinet on 24 September 1992. Believing her acting career was ruined and aware that newspapers were making money out of the story and she wasn't, de Sancha hired publicist Max Clifford to sell her story to various newspapers. She made about £30,000 from those sales. The furore that followed publication left her deeply unhappy. \"It was emotional rape\", de Sancha told an interviewer ten years after the scandal referring to the bugging of her flat which led to the affair being made public. She has had scarcely any work as an actress since the scandal, and considers the scandal as the reason a subsequent marriage failed. She was the subject of an instalment of the Discovery Channel documentary series The Mistress in 2002. De Sancha now runs an Indian textiles importing business in Portobello Road, Kensington, west London."

  "text" : "Forbes Collins is a versatile British character actor, seen in supporting roles. The serious demeanour he gives to some of the 'country-fied' characters he has played is lent gravity via a down-to-earth manner combined with his trademark serious expression. He is best known for his role as King John in the popular comedy Maid Marian and Her Merry Men. He also starred in the episode All About Scoring, Innit? in the critically acclaimed drama, Minder, playing Arklow, as well as appearing as Jonas in Jesus of Nazareth, some episodes of the first series of Blackadder, and playing the Chief Officer in Doctor Who's Vengeance on Varos. Collins also played Zacky Martin in Poldark (1975), playing a leading male member in the village of Sawle and supporter of Captain Poldark, whose house Nampara was nearby. When the villagers of Sawle try one of their own for murder, Zacky is prominent in leading the process, advocating using \"the old way\". This uses a candle which, should it stop burning before the end, is taken as 'proof' of guilt. In Poldark, with 'sentence' passed, as the 'guilty' man (who professes his genuine guilt) is taken away, the viewer sees that the wick in the candle had been pre-cut, and the flame would have naturally extinguished anyway. In the quietly memorable and chilling scene that follows, the 'guilty' man is hurled from the cliffs to his death. Other appearances include the 1974 \"Dixon Of Dock Green\" episode, \"Seven For A Secret - Never To Be Told\". His character, Pengelly, appears to have withheld information from Dock Green police who are investigating the death of a woman in a gas explosion. He has also played policemen himself, notably Chief Superintendent Bailey in three episodes of the P. D. James-penned Adam Dalgliesh story, \"Shroud For A Nightingale\" (which TV mini-series starred Roy Marsden as Dalgliesh)."

  "text" : "Michael Melia (born 1945) is an established British actor best known for his work on television. Melia was born in Berkshire and attended St. Mary's College, Twickenham, the oldest Roman Catholic college in England. Before taking up acting he was a teacher. At one stage he ran a bar in Spain and thought about applying for a pub tenancy in England. However the idea was vetoed by his wife, former actress turned teacher, Celia Melia. He began acting in television in the early 1970s, usually playing heavies or policemen, though he spent four years performing classic plays with the National Theatre. He joined the BBC One soap opera EastEnders in 1990 as pub landlord Eddie Royle; however he lasted just over a year in this role as his character was killed off in September 1991 after being stabbed by Nick Cotton (John Altman) who was later tried for the murder but cleared. After leaving EastEnders, he appeared as Frank Dagley on Dangerfield; and, more recently, Jerry Block for over a hundred episodes of the footballing soap opera Dream Team. His rugged features have led to parts in numerous crime dramas: The Sweeney, The Bill, Minder in the Series 1 episode Monday Night Fever, C.A.T.S. Eyes, Campion, The Chinese Detective, Dempsey and Makepeace, Rumpole of the Bailey, Inspector Morse, Maigret, The Detectives, Daylight Robbery and New Tricks. He has also had parts in many other established dramas including When the Boat Comes In, Coronation Street, Casualty and most recently Doctors and Emmerdale. He is also known for having appeared on Doctor Who in full alien costume as the Terileptil Leader in the 1982 story The Visitation; and had a minor part on Blake's 7. He lives in Hampton Wick, Surrey with his wife and pet cat. He has two children, Tom and Charlotte, who have both appeared as extras in the EastEnders market square. More recently, he has appeared in short films, directed by his son Tom, which can be found on their website www.mean-eyedcat.co.uk.His daughter, Charlotte, also stars. In 2010, he guest starred in Dani's House."

  "text" : "Judy Buxton (born 1949, in Croydon) is an English actress. She graduated from the Rose Bruford College. She then was a regular in the television series General Hospital playing nurse Katy Shaw and had a small part in The Sweeney. She joined the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1979, where she played principal roles until 1982. Her “memorable...and exceptional” performance of Iphigenia in The Greeks and Juliet in Romeo and Juliet were particularly notable. Time magazine critic T.E. Kalem wrote of her “unforgettable” portrayal of Iphigenia: “...as Buxton reaches the heartbreaking conclusion that the one life she has to give for Hellas is the noblest life to have lived, she radiates a great and unforgettable purity of spirit.” She later worked mainly in television, playing Ruth in the television comedy On the Up, Inga, Roj Blake's cousin in Blake's Seven and Susan Protheroe in 1983's production of By The Sword Divided. In 2006 she was in the cast of a well-received UK touring production of Noël Coward’s Star Quality. She appeared in two series-three episodes of Rising Damp, as Caroline Armitage. Buxton is married to Jeffrey Holland, best known as Spike in Hi-de-Hi!."
