  "text" : "Sriniwaspuri (Hindi: श्रीनिवासपुरी) is a small Colony located in the southern part of Delhi, India. This Colony has mainly two sub-colonies - a government colony and a private colony. The government colony has Type-I and Type-II flats under General Pool Residential Accommodation of Central Government maintained by CPWD, and residents here are employees of various Central and attached government offices and their family members. The private colony was initially developed as J.J.Colony Sriniwaspuri. The original residents of this JJ Colony had been residing at Bela Road Jhuggi Basti near Rajghat and were Rajasthani and Punjabi/Multani/Sindhi/Janghi. Being poor, they had been working in and around the Purani Delhi area, the Yamuna area, etc. Most of them were labourers, masons, etc. In 1961, due to a fire accident this Juggi Basti had burnt. Pt. Jawahar Lal Nehru, then the Prime Minister of India, allotted 80 Sq.Yds Plots with a loan of Rs.1000 to every family to build homes. First, 94 Plots in J Block were allotted to Rajasthani families, and Blocks K, L, M, N and O were allotted to the remaining people. Punjabi/Multani/Sindhi/Jhangi people were largest at that time too. Therefore, it is clear that most of the original residents of Sriniwaspuri residing in Blocks J, K, L, M, N, and O have been residing in Sriniwaspuri since 1961, and they may have been residing in Delhi since 1951 or earlier. Thereafter, local people and other people came in this Colony and encroached upon the land, resulting in the more recent P, Q, R, S, and T blocks. The difference may be seen easily that on one hand J.J. Colony having Blocks J, K, L, M, N, and O has well planned roads and buildings, whereas Blocks P, Q, R, S, and T are congested. This part is also known as the private colony wxtension. The private colony extension of Sriniwaspuri grapples with basic issues such as water supply, electricity, and encroachment. This part of Sriniwaspuri has many unregulated businesses such as provisional stores, dairies, and confectionery shops. Over the years, the place has commercialised so much that many residents have started leaving the place. Sriniwaspuri has its own Public Library, Post Office and Police Chowki under Amar Colony police state earlier it had own Police Station, and it also has the famous Bharat Sevasharam Mandir (Hathi Wala Mandir). There is also a CGHS Dispensary, MCD Allopathic Dispensary, MCD Maternity Centre, MCD Homoeopatic Dispensary, MCD Unani Dispensary. The town has several parks (Parks in Government Colony type-II flats are is only well maintained other of them are not seems to be maintained ) for children to play. Most weekends, the play grounds are a sight to watch as you get to see multiple cricket teams playing on the same ground at same time. The town has government run primary and secondary schools separately for boys and girls. Government Boys School is called as G.B.Pant Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya. Girls schools have good discipline and reputation. It seems that there is no discipline in G.B. Pant Boys School because the students may be seen wandering everywhere in school timing frequently in groups wasting their time. School Administration has not seems to be worried about the future of its students (It has happen all after a great Principle of school 'Prem sigh' has leaved the school). There is one private school called Cambridge School it is one of the best school in South Delhi. There is also one Arya Samaj Vidyalaya maintained by Arya Samaj Mandir. There are 3 famous parks here, an ideal for cricketers. these are TOURNAMENT 1, TOURNAMENT 2 and TOURNAMENT 3. TOURNAMENT 1 is also used to arrange marriages. now the condition of sriniwaspuri is improving."

Sidlaphadi literally means in Kannada the Rock of lightning, derived from gaping holes in the natural rock arch, which was formed when a lightning struck.The natural rock bridge structure looks like a wide arch between two sandstone boulders (served as a roof). The rock structure has large, gaping holes in the arch and allows sunlight to enter inside which provides the required light for interiors. It was also a shelter for hunter-gatherer prehistoric people. There is a replica of Sidlaphadi in the Badami archaeological museum, it is dedicated to recreate Sidlaphadi and has posters to provide relevant information about the evolution of man. There are evidences to prove that the Sidlaphadi was a dwelling of prehistoric man."

  "text" : "Chijgam was established around 1850 by Makanbhai Patel and few other families who migrated from Mutwaad. Chijgam and all of its neighboring villages were massive sea salt producing areas for almost 200 years. The area that Chijgam is located on is separated from the Arabian Sea by approximately one mile of land. It is located on Kanai Creek which starts from Toli Talav, north of Navsari and ends up at Arabian Sea. Salt was mainly traded from the Chijgamis to the Banjaras/Vanzaras (gujrati pronunciation) (the gypsy tribe of traders) for money, materials, essentials, food, and jewelry. Eventually technology advanced, and ships were used to transport salt to Mumbai. Adoption of a railroad transportation system replaced Chijgami dependence on the Vanzaras and their camel fleets. Introduction of a fresh water canal system reduced the amount of salt in the sea (brine level) by 40%. The lack of salt eventually ended the salt business that Chijgam was accustomed to. However, canals were useful in rejuvenating farm crops and mango orchards. Despite the demise of the salt manufacturing business, the improvement of the land’s agriculture is why canals were still used. By 1975, opportunities in the diamond cutting and polishing businesses brought prosperity back to Chijgam. Meanwhile, people started to immigrate to Europe and North America. Today Canada and the Persian Gulf have one of the largest number of residents from Chijgam. Dandi is the place where Gandhi concluded his salt march in 1930. Chijgam is located 7–8 miles from Dandi and share the area of salt manufacturing farms with Dandi. Gandhi also visited Mutwaad, Abrama, Panaar while he stayed for one month before his arrest. From the 1920s through the 1940s, several Chijgami residents flourished in the Toddy also known as Palm wine, (a semi-alcoholic drink made from the sap of Palm trees) producing and selling business. Toddy can also be distilled and it is known as arrack everywhere. These Chijgamis traveled as far as Nagpur to run such stores and during the festival of Diwali, would return to Chijgam with great wealth. However, before returning to Chijgam, many of the businessmen would hire musicians from neighboring villages and reenter Chijgam with great fanfare and excitement. They would also hire cooks and hold extravagant celebrations and feasts. Unfortunately for Chijgamis, during the 1930s when Gandhi started his support for liquor prohibition, Taadi stores went out of business. Some Chijgamis went into Shipping business using small clipper ships. They used to transport goods between Goa, Mumbai and Bhavnagar. Advent of trucking business through roads put these families out of shipping business through sea. Farmers have now turned to grow rice, sugarcanes, mangoes & sapodillas (chikoo) Between 1930 through 1970, about 10% of children from Chijgam attended the only high school in the district: the Dahyabhai Sunderji & Bhagwanji Bhimbhai School in Khara Abrama. It is a commute of 8 miles from Chijgam to the DS&BB school. Lalbhai Patel started primary school around 1930's in Chijgam because kids had really hard time to go to Panaar which was only 3 miles commute but through muddy waterway. During the late 60’s, Chijgamis became famous for playing Kabaddi and volleyball. Chijgam sent regularly Kabaddi and volleyball teams to compete at state level. During games, Chijgam’s musical themesong, “The Pride of Chijgam” was loudly played by local bands against rival bannds during what became known as a musical face-off. The band with the loudest and clearest sound often won the battle. Chijgamis used to commute 3–6 miles to Abrama & Panar, carrying 30–35 kg of dehusked rice over their heads to convert it into puffed rice & flattened rice."

With the view of transferring population from densely populated regions of Bihar & Northern Provinces( Uttar Pradesh to waste lands/jungles of Burma, the British Government offered large tracts of land in Burma by way of Grants,to big Indian Zamindars & Princely States to take up the migration work. Invitations were sent to the Maharaja of Dumraon as well as to the Dewan of Dumraon State. While the Maharaja declined the offer, Dewan Jai Prakash Lall C.I.E. accepted the offer and was granted 18340 acres of land in Zayawadi region in Myanmar by the British Empire. Dewan Jai Prakash Lall C.I.E. & his son Rai Bahadur Harihar Prasad Singh took neighboring people from Bihar & Northern Provinces to Myanmar and let them cut and clean the forest in that land and allowed them to grow paddy & sugar cane to earn living. In 1934-35 a sugar mill, bought from Britain was set up by Rai Bahadur Harihar Prasad Singh & his son, Mr. Chandradeva Prakash Sinha. The mill had a capacity of 1000 tons per year initially, which was expanded to 2,500 tons before the second World War. The mill was the largest sugar mill in Burma of the time. New machinery was also bought during the war days to further expand capacity. The sugar factory had been running till 1952-53. In 1954 the mill was nationalized by the Myanmar Government and the factory was run by the Government thereafter."

  "text" : "Jaisinghpur is a small town and Sub-Division in Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh, India. There is only one tehsil under Sub-Division Jaisinghpur, whish is situated at Jaisinghpur itself. Population of Jaisinghpur Town is 1,273 and overall population of Jaisinghpur Sub-Division is 58,623. It was named after the name of Katoch king of Princely ordered state Kangra-Lambagraon, Maharaja Jai Singh. It is situated on the bank of river Beas. It is known for its \"chaugan.\" There are several notable temples in the town such as Janaki Nath temple, Radhey Krishan temple near Bus Adda,Laxmi Narayan temple, Baba Mani Ram Temple, Neel Kanth Mahadev Temple, Dhudu Mahadev Mandir, Guga temple (Called Gangoti near Shitala Mata Mandir), Shitala Mata temple, a Dargah midtown, popularly known as Baba Shah Mast Ali Dargah and a Gurudwara on Jaisinghpur Lambagoan road. Shitala Mata temple is famous temple of the town on Tinbar-Palampur road. Another famous temple is Jankinath temple. There are many natural water resources in the town.'Baayein' near PWD Rest House and 'Naoun' is favorite place for all boys to have fun by swimming in summer, however it serves the major water need of people. Jaisinghpur is also famous for its vegetable production on the banks of Beas river the spot is popularly known as Bhuare ke Bagh. Once Jaisinghpur was also famous for vegetable growing on the banks of river Beas i.e. popularly known as bhuaray ka bagh. But nowadays the growing of crops including vegetables has been stopped in Jainsinghpur and entire adjoining area because of the increase of stray animals, monkeys, wild pigs, rabbits, deer’s (Kakkar, Barahsinga and neel gaye), which spoil crops completely. The menace of wild and stray animals has increased nowadays manifold probably because tigers/leopards which were responsible for keeping such animals under control have been killed by local poachers. Jaisinghpur has been also known as the first place in Kangra or perhaps in entire Himachal for staging Ramlila festival. Ramlila of Jaisinghpur started some 90 years ago and almost all the actors were Brahmin, mainly from Awasthi community. Pandit Balkishan Awasthi, a native of Jaisinghpur who lived in Mumbai for his work and also associated with theatre there, have brought all the Drama items required for Ramlila from Mumbai and started Ramlila festival single handedly at Jaisinghpur. He used to play the role of Ravana in the Ramlila and become very popular because of his dialogue delivery in strong deep voice and due to his tall, handsome personality. The uniqueness of the Ramlila was the Sanskrit language used at that time, most Ramlilas in North India are based on the 16th century Avadhi version of Ramayana, Ramcharitmanas, written by Gosvami Tulsidas entirely in verse, thus used as dialogues in most traditional versions. Jaisinghpur is also famous for its annual fair also known as holian which are celebrated in the month of march during the colour festival of holi. The Holian of Jaisinghpur are famous for its mouth watering aalu chholey and Jalebi and continues for almost a week. Holding of Kushti (wrestling) at Dargah during Holis is an annual affair watched by several visitors."

  "text" : "Angadipuram Laterite is a National Geological Monument identified in Angadipuram town in Malappuram district in the southern Indian state of Kerala, India. The special significance of Angadipuram to laterites is that it was here that Dr. Francis Buchanan-Hamilton, a professional surgeon, gave the first account of this rock type, in his report of 1807, as \"indurated clay\", ideally suited for building construction. This formation falls outside the general classification of rocks namely, the igneous, metamorphic, or sedimentary rocks but is an exclusively \"sedimentary residual product\". It has a generally pitted and porous appearance. The name laterite was first coined in India, by Buchanan and its etymology is traced to the Latin word \"letritis\" that means bricks. This exceptional formation is found above parent rock types of various composition namely, charnockite, leptynite, anorthosite and gabbro in Kerala. It is found over basalt in the states of Goa, Maharashtra and in some regions of Karnataka. In Gujarat in western India, impressive formations of laterite are found over granite, shale and sandstone.. Apart from its use as bricks in building construction, it has other substantial economic value, since it has been established that laterites are closely juxtaposed with aluminium ore (bauxite), iron ore and nickel ore mineral deposits in many parts of Kerala. The GSI has erected a monument at Angadipuram (see picture) where the laterite formations were first identified, as one of the 26 monuments declared as National Geological Monuments, on the occasion of the \"International Conference on Laterization\" held in 1979. Angadipuram is also well known as a pilgrimage centre for its famous temples, the Thirumandhamkunnu temple and the Tali temple."

The prison has been nicknamed \"Malaysia's Gitmo\" (referring to the Guantanamo Bay or Gitmo prison for similar detainees in Cuba run by the United States), and holds about a hundred detainees as of 2006. During the Malayan Emergency between 1948 and 1960, Kamunting was the site of a major British/Commonwealth military base, there being a large garrison for the 28th Commonwealth Independent Infantry Brigade and also one of the three British Military Hospitals (BMHs) in Malaya. Between Taiping and Kamunting is one of the main Military Cemeteries in Malaya. Over the many years of the conflict against the Communist terrorists, thousands of British, Australian, New Zealand, Fijian and Gurkha troops lived - and died - in and around Kamunting and Taiping. Kamunting houses the main bus station (Kamunting Raya) for Taiping town. Soon the Taiping train station will relocate there too. It has a weekly night market every Saturday night near the bus station that sells all sorts of local fresh produce and food stuffs. There are also fruit sellers along the road leading to the Kamunting bus stops which sell seasonal fruits like durian and mangosteens. It also connects Taiping to the North-South Expressway via the northern exit. Major tourist spot is Bukit Jana, which has a waterfall and streams off the range of Bukit Larut. The Bukit Jana Golf & Country Club is also situated nearby. Plans for Taiping sports centre, which includes a 15000-seater stadium, indoor venues and extreme sports site, are still under consideration."

This was found to be true and afterwards there occurred a flow of Hindus from all over the country to pay their homage to Lord Shiva.
