  "text" : "Wadapally, formerly known as Vazeerabad, is situated in Nalgonda district of Telangana, India, near Miryalaguda. Wadapally comes under the assembly constituency of Miryalaguda, this town is 24 km from Miryalaguda town. Wadapally is major producer of Cement in Nalgonda district due to the availability of lime stone across the borders of Nalgonda district and neighboring Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh. Wadapally is famous for Lord Shiva and is situated on the sangamam of River Krishna and Musi. It is accessible through bus and train from different places throughout Telangana such as Nalgonda, Miryalaguda, Hyderabad and from Andhra Pradesh such as Guntur, Nellore, Secunderabad, Tirupathi, Dachepalle. The two temples located in Wadapally are the Sri Meenakshi Agasteswara swami temple and Sri Lakshmi Narasimha swami temple. This town is located at the confluence of the Krishna and Musi rivers. The place is known for the temple of Sri Meenakshi Agasteswara Swamy which was constructed by the Kakatiya rulers in the 12th century. The significance of the temple is that there is a crevice on top of the Shivalinga which is always full of water. Even if some water is removed the original level of the water is maintained. There is no logical reason that can explain this phenomenon especially since the Shivalinga is situated about 120 metres above the water level in the river. Sri Narasimha Swamy is believed to bless the devotees with health and prosperity who pray to him soulfully.The sacred river Krishna has a very prominent place in the history of our country. Wadapally is the place where river Krishna and Musi River meet and jointly flow. Wadapally is near Vishnupuram of Nalgonda District in Dameracherla mandal and in between Bibinagar and Nadikudi Railway Stations. The coming together of these two rivers in the shape of \"L\" attract irresistibly the viewers. At the confluence of these rivers, there is a very old temple of Sri Narasimha Swamy. According to the Puranas, Vyasa Bhagavan knowing the piousness of the place, meditated for a long time for the manifestation of Sri Narasimha Swamy. Commiserating at the continued penance of Vyasa Bhagavan Lord Maha Vishnu again transfigured as Narasimha Swamy and appeared to the former, with ferocious looks of a lion. Vyasa Bhagavan experienced Lord Narasimha, who was taking breath with uncontrolled anger, coming to him just after killing Hiranyakasipu. He, therefore, entreated Sri Narasimha Swamy to manifest at Wadapally in that form only. Accordingly, Sri Narasimha Swamy manifested there to bless the devotees and to alleviate their difficulties. It is believed that even now the idol breathes in and out. The temple authorities have arranged two lamps. One of the lights of the lamp used for showing the face of the Lord will be quivering to testify the fact that the Lord is taking breath and letting it out. The light of the other lamp, which is kept below remain resolutely. There are a two mosques in vazeerabad which has historical importance. One is Masjid-E-Sara-E-Meer-Alam and second one is Qutub shahi mosque. There are many polish mills, cement and power plants are there in wadapally Surroundings.Also wadapally has Post office, Police Station, andState Bank of Hyderabad. India Cements has a Cement plant at Vishnupuram under Wadapally village limits. It is under expansion with an expenditure of Rs. 700 millions."

  "text" : "Sriniwaspuri (Hindi: श्रीनिवासपुरी) is a small Colony located in the southern part of Delhi, India. This Colony has mainly two sub-colonies - a government colony and a private colony. The government colony has Type-I and Type-II flats under General Pool Residential Accommodation of Central Government maintained by CPWD, and residents here are employees of various Central and attached government offices and their family members. The private colony was initially developed as J.J.Colony Sriniwaspuri. The original residents of this JJ Colony had been residing at Bela Road Jhuggi Basti near Rajghat and were Rajasthani and Punjabi/Multani/Sindhi/Janghi. Being poor, they had been working in and around the Purani Delhi area, the Yamuna area, etc. Most of them were labourers, masons, etc. In 1961, due to a fire accident this Juggi Basti had burnt. Pt. Jawahar Lal Nehru, then the Prime Minister of India, allotted 80 Sq.Yds Plots with a loan of Rs.1000 to every family to build homes. First, 94 Plots in J Block were allotted to Rajasthani families, and Blocks K, L, M, N and O were allotted to the remaining people. Punjabi/Multani/Sindhi/Jhangi people were largest at that time too. Therefore, it is clear that most of the original residents of Sriniwaspuri residing in Blocks J, K, L, M, N, and O have been residing in Sriniwaspuri since 1961, and they may have been residing in Delhi since 1951 or earlier. Thereafter, local people and other people came in this Colony and encroached upon the land, resulting in the more recent P, Q, R, S, and T blocks. The difference may be seen easily that on one hand J.J. Colony having Blocks J, K, L, M, N, and O has well planned roads and buildings, whereas Blocks P, Q, R, S, and T are congested. This part is also known as the private colony wxtension. The private colony extension of Sriniwaspuri grapples with basic issues such as water supply, electricity, and encroachment. This part of Sriniwaspuri has many unregulated businesses such as provisional stores, dairies, and confectionery shops. Over the years, the place has commercialised so much that many residents have started leaving the place. Sriniwaspuri has its own Public Library, Post Office and Police Chowki under Amar Colony police state earlier it had own Police Station, and it also has the famous Bharat Sevasharam Mandir (Hathi Wala Mandir). There is also a CGHS Dispensary, MCD Allopathic Dispensary, MCD Maternity Centre, MCD Homoeopatic Dispensary, MCD Unani Dispensary. The town has several parks (Parks in Government Colony type-II flats are is only well maintained other of them are not seems to be maintained ) for children to play. Most weekends, the play grounds are a sight to watch as you get to see multiple cricket teams playing on the same ground at same time. The town has government run primary and secondary schools separately for boys and girls. Government Boys School is called as G.B.Pant Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya. Girls schools have good discipline and reputation. It seems that there is no discipline in G.B. Pant Boys School because the students may be seen wandering everywhere in school timing frequently in groups wasting their time. School Administration has not seems to be worried about the future of its students (It has happen all after a great Principle of school 'Prem sigh' has leaved the school). There is one private school called Cambridge School it is one of the best school in South Delhi. There is also one Arya Samaj Vidyalaya maintained by Arya Samaj Mandir. There are 3 famous parks here, an ideal for cricketers. these are TOURNAMENT 1, TOURNAMENT 2 and TOURNAMENT 3. TOURNAMENT 1 is also used to arrange marriages. now the condition of sriniwaspuri is improving."

  "text" : "Sarchu (also known as Sir Bhum Chun) is a major halt point with tented accommodation in the Himalayas on the Leh-Manali Highway, on the boundary between Himachal Pradesh and Ladakh (Jammu and Kashmir) in India. It is situated between Baralacha La to the south and Lachulung La to the north, at an altitude of 4,290 m (14,070 ft). The journey along the Manali-Leh highway at high altitude and variable road conditions, normally takes two days, so travellers and tourists use this spot as an overnight stop. An Indian army camp is sited nearby on the banks of the Tsarap Chu river. The highway and thus the camp are closed during the winter, when snow blocks the high passes along the road. This spot can also be used as a start point for the difficult trek into the Zanskar region of Ladakh."

Situated in Nevasa taluka in Ahmednagar district, the village is known for its popular temple of Shani, the Hindu god associated with the planet (graha) Saturn. Shingnapur is 35 km from Ahmednagar city. Shingnapur is also famous for the fact that no house in the village has doors, only door frames. Despite this, no theft was reported in the village until 2010 when cash and items worth Rs. 35000/- were stolen from a vehicle, then in 2011 when Rs. 50000/-, gold rings, mobile phone, etc. was stolen from the home of a retired official of the Shree Shanaishwar Devasthan Trust  and then again in January 2012 gold ornaments were stolen from within the temple. Still villagers never keep their valuables under lock and key. The temple is believed to be a \"jagrut devasthan\" (lit. \"alive temple\"), meaning that a deity still resides in the temple icon. Villagers believe that god Shani punishes anyone attempting theft. The deity here is \"Swayambhu\" (Sanskrit: self-evolved deity) that is self emerged from earth in form of black, imposing stone. Though no one knows the exact period, it is believed that the Swayambhu Shanaishwara statue was found by shepherds of the then local hamlet. It is believed to be in existence at least since the start of Kali yuga. The village has a post office and a high school known as Shri Shanishwar Vidya Mandir besides the primary schools run by the Zilla Parishad. The chief source of water supply in the village is wells. In January 2011, the United Commercial (UCO) Bank opened a 'lockless' branch in the village, the first of its kind in the country, taking note of the near-zero crime rate in the region. The local police were reported to be unhappy over this development and that it amounted to a breach of conditions, because the Central government of India has made it mandatory for all banks to have high security.The bank has doors,but they will always remain open. However, it was reported by the local legislator and the bank officials that adequate precautions were being taken for the safety of lockers and important documents."

Sidlaphadi literally means in Kannada the Rock of lightning, derived from gaping holes in the natural rock arch, which was formed when a lightning struck.The natural rock bridge structure looks like a wide arch between two sandstone boulders (served as a roof). The rock structure has large, gaping holes in the arch and allows sunlight to enter inside which provides the required light for interiors. It was also a shelter for hunter-gatherer prehistoric people. There is a replica of Sidlaphadi in the Badami archaeological museum, it is dedicated to recreate Sidlaphadi and has posters to provide relevant information about the evolution of man. There are evidences to prove that the Sidlaphadi was a dwelling of prehistoric man."

The construction of the project took much more time than planned due to strong currents and terrorism. The Project is situated in Udalguri District within jurisdiction of Bodoland Territorial Autonomous District (B.T.A.D.) aimed to provide assured irrigation to an area of 41.683 hectares (103.00 acres) in five development blocks viz. Udalguri, Rowta, Kalaigaon, Mazbat and Bechimari under Udalguri Civil Sub-Division. The Project generates 20 MW of electricity out of 5 No. falls per 9 metres (30 ft) drop. The revised estimated cost of the project is 401.24 crores. As of 2009 70% of the work had been completed and targeted to complete the balance work by 2010."

A Sonia Vihar power plant is recently being built in Bhjanpura. There are few major attractions in this location, but it is a well-suited area because of the nearby interstate bus terminal, railway station and educational institutions like Lal Bhadur Shastri college affiliated with Delhi University 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) from there and Northern Indian Engineering college affiliated with I.P. University is also 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) from there. The main landmark of Bhajanpura is Bhajanpura Chowk, which is very busy all time. There are various blocks in Bhajanpura such as A,B,C,D etc. and every street is given a number. Unlike its neighborhood Yamuna VIhar , Bhajanpura is not well planned with no parks at all making it a congested place. Interesting fact is that Bhajanpura is actually Block A of Yamuna Vihar (as per the locals)."

  "text" : "Chijgam was established around 1850 by Makanbhai Patel and few other families who migrated from Mutwaad. Chijgam and all of its neighboring villages were massive sea salt producing areas for almost 200 years. The area that Chijgam is located on is separated from the Arabian Sea by approximately one mile of land. It is located on Kanai Creek which starts from Toli Talav, north of Navsari and ends up at Arabian Sea. Salt was mainly traded from the Chijgamis to the Banjaras/Vanzaras (gujrati pronunciation) (the gypsy tribe of traders) for money, materials, essentials, food, and jewelry. Eventually technology advanced, and ships were used to transport salt to Mumbai. Adoption of a railroad transportation system replaced Chijgami dependence on the Vanzaras and their camel fleets. Introduction of a fresh water canal system reduced the amount of salt in the sea (brine level) by 40%. The lack of salt eventually ended the salt business that Chijgam was accustomed to. However, canals were useful in rejuvenating farm crops and mango orchards. Despite the demise of the salt manufacturing business, the improvement of the land’s agriculture is why canals were still used. By 1975, opportunities in the diamond cutting and polishing businesses brought prosperity back to Chijgam. Meanwhile, people started to immigrate to Europe and North America. Today Canada and the Persian Gulf have one of the largest number of residents from Chijgam. Dandi is the place where Gandhi concluded his salt march in 1930. Chijgam is located 7–8 miles from Dandi and share the area of salt manufacturing farms with Dandi. Gandhi also visited Mutwaad, Abrama, Panaar while he stayed for one month before his arrest. From the 1920s through the 1940s, several Chijgami residents flourished in the Toddy also known as Palm wine, (a semi-alcoholic drink made from the sap of Palm trees) producing and selling business. Toddy can also be distilled and it is known as arrack everywhere. These Chijgamis traveled as far as Nagpur to run such stores and during the festival of Diwali, would return to Chijgam with great wealth. However, before returning to Chijgam, many of the businessmen would hire musicians from neighboring villages and reenter Chijgam with great fanfare and excitement. They would also hire cooks and hold extravagant celebrations and feasts. Unfortunately for Chijgamis, during the 1930s when Gandhi started his support for liquor prohibition, Taadi stores went out of business. Some Chijgamis went into Shipping business using small clipper ships. They used to transport goods between Goa, Mumbai and Bhavnagar. Advent of trucking business through roads put these families out of shipping business through sea. Farmers have now turned to grow rice, sugarcanes, mangoes & sapodillas (chikoo) Between 1930 through 1970, about 10% of children from Chijgam attended the only high school in the district: the Dahyabhai Sunderji & Bhagwanji Bhimbhai School in Khara Abrama. It is a commute of 8 miles from Chijgam to the DS&BB school. Lalbhai Patel started primary school around 1930's in Chijgam because kids had really hard time to go to Panaar which was only 3 miles commute but through muddy waterway. During the late 60’s, Chijgamis became famous for playing Kabaddi and volleyball. Chijgam sent regularly Kabaddi and volleyball teams to compete at state level. During games, Chijgam’s musical themesong, “The Pride of Chijgam” was loudly played by local bands against rival bannds during what became known as a musical face-off. The band with the loudest and clearest sound often won the battle. Chijgamis used to commute 3–6 miles to Abrama & Panar, carrying 30–35 kg of dehusked rice over their heads to convert it into puffed rice & flattened rice."

With the view of transferring population from densely populated regions of Bihar & Northern Provinces( Uttar Pradesh to waste lands/jungles of Burma, the British Government offered large tracts of land in Burma by way of Grants,to big Indian Zamindars & Princely States to take up the migration work. Invitations were sent to the Maharaja of Dumraon as well as to the Dewan of Dumraon State. While the Maharaja declined the offer, Dewan Jai Prakash Lall C.I.E. accepted the offer and was granted 18340 acres of land in Zayawadi region in Myanmar by the British Empire. Dewan Jai Prakash Lall C.I.E. & his son Rai Bahadur Harihar Prasad Singh took neighboring people from Bihar & Northern Provinces to Myanmar and let them cut and clean the forest in that land and allowed them to grow paddy & sugar cane to earn living. In 1934-35 a sugar mill, bought from Britain was set up by Rai Bahadur Harihar Prasad Singh & his son, Mr. Chandradeva Prakash Sinha. The mill had a capacity of 1000 tons per year initially, which was expanded to 2,500 tons before the second World War. The mill was the largest sugar mill in Burma of the time. New machinery was also bought during the war days to further expand capacity. The sugar factory had been running till 1952-53. In 1954 the mill was nationalized by the Myanmar Government and the factory was run by the Government thereafter."

Feeding Hills contains one quarter of the total population, as well as Provin Mountain, the highest point in the town, and many moderate-sized farms. Today, Feeding Hills is under extensive land development in and around the Provin Mountain communities. Several farms have been split up and sold to developers, resulting in an increased real estate market. Older sections of Feeding Hills, such as those closer to Line Street and Agawam High School, have remained much the same, although in recent years have experienced an exodus of businesses to other parts of town. Feeding Hills contains several churches, shopping centers, and a variety of eateries. It is home to WWLP-TV's transmitting site atop Provin Mountain (their studio has since moved to Chicopee). Agawam's police station can be found on Springfield St., one of the subsection's most populous roads.

There is evidence of prehistoric (pre contact) human settlement in Nayarit. On the Punta de Mita peninsula, a hilltop archaeological site known as Careyeros Hill has been dated to circa 800 AD. Punta Mita is surrounded on three sides by nine and a half miles of Pacific Ocean beaches and coves including Litibu Bay. Punta Mita is at the same latitude as the Hawaiian Islands. It is kept comfortable year round by gentle sea breezes, with average summer temperatures around 85 °F (29 °C), and 75 °F (24 °C) during winter months. Because of its temperate, tropical climate, Punta Mita is a popular but low-key vacation spot. Hollywood celebrities such as Kylie Jenner, Kendall Jenner, Tyga Demi Moore, Orlando Bloom and Vince Vaughn have vacationed at Casa Aramara in Punta Mita, a private resort built by Joe Francis. Billionaire Thomas Siebel has also visited the village. Punta Mita has several residential communities ranging from condominiums and townhomes to private, single-family villas. All of these homes set among a rural Mexican fishing colony town. It is also the location of the Four Seasons Resort, Punta Mita as well as the St. Regis Resort, Punta Mita. The Marieta Islands are a 15-minute boat ride from Punta Mita and are a Mexican national park."

  "text" : "Jaisinghpur is a small town and Sub-Division in Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh, India. There is only one tehsil under Sub-Division Jaisinghpur, whish is situated at Jaisinghpur itself. Population of Jaisinghpur Town is 1,273 and overall population of Jaisinghpur Sub-Division is 58,623. It was named after the name of Katoch king of Princely ordered state Kangra-Lambagraon, Maharaja Jai Singh. It is situated on the bank of river Beas. It is known for its \"chaugan.\" There are several notable temples in the town such as Janaki Nath temple, Radhey Krishan temple near Bus Adda,Laxmi Narayan temple, Baba Mani Ram Temple, Neel Kanth Mahadev Temple, Dhudu Mahadev Mandir, Guga temple (Called Gangoti near Shitala Mata Mandir), Shitala Mata temple, a Dargah midtown, popularly known as Baba Shah Mast Ali Dargah and a Gurudwara on Jaisinghpur Lambagoan road. Shitala Mata temple is famous temple of the town on Tinbar-Palampur road. Another famous temple is Jankinath temple. There are many natural water resources in the town.'Baayein' near PWD Rest House and 'Naoun' is favorite place for all boys to have fun by swimming in summer, however it serves the major water need of people. Jaisinghpur is also famous for its vegetable production on the banks of Beas river the spot is popularly known as Bhuare ke Bagh. Once Jaisinghpur was also famous for vegetable growing on the banks of river Beas i.e. popularly known as bhuaray ka bagh. But nowadays the growing of crops including vegetables has been stopped in Jainsinghpur and entire adjoining area because of the increase of stray animals, monkeys, wild pigs, rabbits, deer’s (Kakkar, Barahsinga and neel gaye), which spoil crops completely. The menace of wild and stray animals has increased nowadays manifold probably because tigers/leopards which were responsible for keeping such animals under control have been killed by local poachers. Jaisinghpur has been also known as the first place in Kangra or perhaps in entire Himachal for staging Ramlila festival. Ramlila of Jaisinghpur started some 90 years ago and almost all the actors were Brahmin, mainly from Awasthi community. Pandit Balkishan Awasthi, a native of Jaisinghpur who lived in Mumbai for his work and also associated with theatre there, have brought all the Drama items required for Ramlila from Mumbai and started Ramlila festival single handedly at Jaisinghpur. He used to play the role of Ravana in the Ramlila and become very popular because of his dialogue delivery in strong deep voice and due to his tall, handsome personality. The uniqueness of the Ramlila was the Sanskrit language used at that time, most Ramlilas in North India are based on the 16th century Avadhi version of Ramayana, Ramcharitmanas, written by Gosvami Tulsidas entirely in verse, thus used as dialogues in most traditional versions. Jaisinghpur is also famous for its annual fair also known as holian which are celebrated in the month of march during the colour festival of holi. The Holian of Jaisinghpur are famous for its mouth watering aalu chholey and Jalebi and continues for almost a week. Holding of Kushti (wrestling) at Dargah during Holis is an annual affair watched by several visitors."

  "text" : "Nguroje is a town found on the mambilla plateau,in Sardauna Local Government Area of Taraba State in eastern Nigeria.It is easy to see that the term \"Nguroje\" is an original rendering in Fulfulde (Fulani) language, derived from \"Ngu-ram\", meaning economic income. Thus, \"Ngu-ro-je\" (economic enclaves) is a plural of \"Ngu-ro-re\" (an economic enclave). The straight-away translation of the term \"Nguroje\" in English language is \"Living Springs\". \"Guroji\" is a non-Fulfulde rendering, perhaps by certain tribes that later came to settle in the town with the original Fulbe founders of the town.History of NgurojeOld Mbungnu (Mbungnu, Kwuo, Guroji, Nguroje) Old Mbungnu (Kwuo or Kwu-Mbungnu) was the cradle of the Mbunip and Magu clans of Mambilla down to about 1890 before they separated from here. Some “Kobira” came at the beginning of the British administration and settled on the abandoned Mbungnu site, obviously a little before the Hausa man, Musa Bichi, arrived at the camp. The kobiras were former abductees, majority of whom had escaped from their abductors after the Anglo-German War at Banyo of 1915. A few however came a few years before 1915. In the “Kobira” section, the Ward headship followed no specific line. The first Ward Head was one ‘Hamajulde’ who died in 1935. Then, ‘Dika Pullo’ became Ward Head in 1937 and died 1939. ‘Dika Pullo’ came from Tibati. Like most “Kobira”, neither his ancestry nor that of Hamajulde is ascertained. The next Ward Head was Barde, said by some to have been indigenous. He took over rulership in 1940. The Kobira, because of their “detention” or “incarceration” outside their homelands, usually lost their culture and became “elements of no culture”. They commonly betrayed their roots, in many instances pretending to be allies of their own erstwhile tormentors. Many of these Kobiras were simply those who mixed with Fulanis in their sojourning and tended to behave like Fulanis. This is not to show that all the existing inhabitants of Kwu-Mbungnu were by 1915 all Kobira. There were indeed remnants of the pre-existing Kwu-Mbungnu people who were erroneously classed with the Kobira.Hausa traders also pitched their tents at Kwu-Mbungnu on the ruins (“Guroji” = “ruins”) at the end German rule (c.1915) and inception of British suzerainty. The first itinerant Hausa traders then included he aforementioned Musa Bichi from Bichi of Kano, who was based in Garbabi and used to travel through Mambilla to Bamenda for trading just before the end of German rule. Under the British, he finally relocated from Garbabi to Old Mbungnu possibly in the late 1920s. He became the first Hausa to settle here at Old Mbungnu site. Musa Bichi of Kano thus became the first of the Hausa-settler trading colony that met the Kobira on the ruins of Kwu-Mbungnu. He was born and bred in Bichi near Kano and became the first Sarkin Hausawa (Ward Head) of the Hausa trading section of Kwu-Mbungnu, later called “Guroji”, Fulani term for ‘ruined town’ (a name used, until much later, exclusively by the newcomers at that time). Musa Bichi was the first head of only the Hausa section and was still Ward Head by 1932 (1938 I.R). By that year, there was no Fulani ward or head in the camp, the rare visiting graziers being noticed only in bush grass shacks.When the cattle selling point was first set up here by the British in about 1927, more and more Hausa traders and Fulani cattle sellers were attracted in the 1930s, more so by the opportunity provided by the opening in 1926 of the Government-organized Trade Route through Mambilla to Bamenda.In 2005, Kwu-Mbungnu (with the “Guroje” misnomer) was made one of 20 districts created by the 2005 Order. Historically, it had been the territorial jurisdiction of the Mbon Mbunibi (Chief of Mbunip) and the 1938 Intelligence Report suggested its subsequent return to the Chief of Mbunip."

The famous pearl belt known as the Gulf of Mannarin the Bay of Bengal is dotted with small islands Appa Tivu, Nallathanni Theevu, Shuli Tivu,Uppu Tanni Tivu, Talari Tivu and Musal Tivu. The coastal line of Devipattinam is formed by series of small bays and finest coral reefs in Thiruppaalaikudi. The prime occupations of the people were pearl, conch, sea trade and transport. The mid-20th century saw a decline in the occupations of the people of Devipattinam, with the advent of the surface transport the Merchant Navies faded away and Devipattinam ceased to be a harbour and port. The cultured pearl industry and the mindless dragnet fishing that destroyed the coral reefs, choked the once robust pearl trade or Muthu Salabam. The conch and coral industries declined due to new regulations and restrictions. Devipattinam is renowned for its communal harmony. The majority of the population here is Muslim with people of other faith Hindu, Christians living together. Devipattinam has 6 mosque. They are Chinna pallivasal, Periya pallivasal, Thaqua pallivasal, Bukhariya pallivasal, Gandhinagar pallivasal. The migration of the people after the decline of the marine trade and industry resulted in people exploring the other parts of the globe. Devipattinam has a large expatriate population and a very highest literary rate.[2] This enable the people of Devipattinam now span the globe and are active merchants in the Gulf, far east, Us and European markets. The younger generation is now gainfully employed a departure from its predominant merchant/trader mindset."

It has all the basic amenities maintained to a sufficiently pleasing level to meet the demands of the residents. Children's playgrounds, parks and parking lots are present in each of its blocks. Residents from here usually shop from the markets located in Bhajanpura. Yamuna Vihar is a major educational hub for north east Delhi. It has Bhim Rao Ambedkar College of Delhi University, Aakriti School of English Language Near C-12 Market and Bachpan Playway School near DESU office.

Apart from this a Gurudwara, a Mosque & many other temples add to the religious aspect of the colony. Aggarwal dharamshala, Brahmin samaj dharamshala and community centers are also there.There are lot of parks in Yamuna Vihar. Some of the parks are dedicated to the usage of women (e.g. Mahila Park) and old age people. These parks do play a big role in making Yamuna Vihar a green and beautiful area.There is proper Police patrolling and monitoring in the area.Amongst its nearby areas, Yamuna Vihar is the only well-planned locality. Transportation from Yamua Vihar to Yamuna river crossing is messed up and need to be improved. One of the steps taken by the state government to improve transportation is the upcoming Signature Bridge, which is only at a distance of 4 km (2.5 mi). The upcoming Delhi Metro project will also improve this situation.It has many restaurants like the yellow chilli, Pizza Diet, Giani's, Basinghey etc. in and around it. The main road of yamuna vihar falls into commercial property."

  "text" : "Angadipuram Laterite is a National Geological Monument identified in Angadipuram town in Malappuram district in the southern Indian state of Kerala, India. The special significance of Angadipuram to laterites is that it was here that Dr. Francis Buchanan-Hamilton, a professional surgeon, gave the first account of this rock type, in his report of 1807, as \"indurated clay\", ideally suited for building construction. This formation falls outside the general classification of rocks namely, the igneous, metamorphic, or sedimentary rocks but is an exclusively \"sedimentary residual product\". It has a generally pitted and porous appearance. The name laterite was first coined in India, by Buchanan and its etymology is traced to the Latin word \"letritis\" that means bricks. This exceptional formation is found above parent rock types of various composition namely, charnockite, leptynite, anorthosite and gabbro in Kerala. It is found over basalt in the states of Goa, Maharashtra and in some regions of Karnataka. In Gujarat in western India, impressive formations of laterite are found over granite, shale and sandstone.. Apart from its use as bricks in building construction, it has other substantial economic value, since it has been established that laterites are closely juxtaposed with aluminium ore (bauxite), iron ore and nickel ore mineral deposits in many parts of Kerala. The GSI has erected a monument at Angadipuram (see picture) where the laterite formations were first identified, as one of the 26 monuments declared as National Geological Monuments, on the occasion of the \"International Conference on Laterization\" held in 1979. Angadipuram is also well known as a pilgrimage centre for its famous temples, the Thirumandhamkunnu temple and the Tali temple."

This was found to be true and afterwards there occurred a flow of Hindus from all over the country to pay their homage to Lord Shiva.
