  "text" : "Seutula (Swedish: Sjöskog) is a district in Vantaa, Finland, located inside the curve of the River Vantaa. Seutula is also a village in the medieval town of Helsinki, stretching to Rajakoski in the north, Lavanko in the east covering the whole district of Kiila, and including Sotilaskorpi in the south. On the other hand, the western part of the river's curve, including the Königstedt manor, belongs to the village of Riipilä. Seutula is often considered a region stretching even outside the official district, and it has an active local community. In terms of government, Seutula, Riipilä, and Kiila belong to the Kivistö major district. In the early 1950s, a new airfield for Helsinki was built along the Seutulantie road, stretching from Tuusulantie in Ruskeasanta to Seutula. This airfield was opened in 1952, and became the Helsinki Airport in 1977. Already during its construction, the airfield was commonly called the Seutula airfield, because Tuusulantie had a sign pointing to Seutula. In reality, the airfield was built about 8 kilometres southeast from Seutula, in the northern parts of Veromiehenkylä and Kirkonkylä. Nowadays, Lentokenttä (Finnish for \"airfield\") is its own district in Vantaa. The name Seutula is often connected to prisons, although there never has been a prison in Seutula. The reason for the connection is that the airfield was mainly built using prisoner labour. Some of the prisoners used to build the airfield were public figures of the 1960s, convicted of driving under influence, bringing the activity to light. An open prison was located in Seutula until 2009. This prison was originally called a labour colony, and one of its inmates in the 1960s was Irwin Goodman, who had made records about the subject called Terveisiä Seutulasta (\"greetings from Seutula\") and Autolla Kanarian saarille (\"to the Canary Islands by car\"), with lyrics by Vexi Salmi."

  "text" : "Chijgam was established around 1850 by Makanbhai Patel and few other families who migrated from Mutwaad. Chijgam and all of its neighboring villages were massive sea salt producing areas for almost 200 years. The area that Chijgam is located on is separated from the Arabian Sea by approximately one mile of land. It is located on Kanai Creek which starts from Toli Talav, north of Navsari and ends up at Arabian Sea. Salt was mainly traded from the Chijgamis to the Banjaras/Vanzaras (gujrati pronunciation) (the gypsy tribe of traders) for money, materials, essentials, food, and jewelry. Eventually technology advanced, and ships were used to transport salt to Mumbai. Adoption of a railroad transportation system replaced Chijgami dependence on the Vanzaras and their camel fleets. Introduction of a fresh water canal system reduced the amount of salt in the sea (brine level) by 40%. The lack of salt eventually ended the salt business that Chijgam was accustomed to. However, canals were useful in rejuvenating farm crops and mango orchards. Despite the demise of the salt manufacturing business, the improvement of the land’s agriculture is why canals were still used. By 1975, opportunities in the diamond cutting and polishing businesses brought prosperity back to Chijgam. Meanwhile, people started to immigrate to Europe and North America. Today Canada and the Persian Gulf have one of the largest number of residents from Chijgam. Dandi is the place where Gandhi concluded his salt march in 1930. Chijgam is located 7–8 miles from Dandi and share the area of salt manufacturing farms with Dandi. Gandhi also visited Mutwaad, Abrama, Panaar while he stayed for one month before his arrest. From the 1920s through the 1940s, several Chijgami residents flourished in the Toddy also known as Palm wine, (a semi-alcoholic drink made from the sap of Palm trees) producing and selling business. Toddy can also be distilled and it is known as arrack everywhere. These Chijgamis traveled as far as Nagpur to run such stores and during the festival of Diwali, would return to Chijgam with great wealth. However, before returning to Chijgam, many of the businessmen would hire musicians from neighboring villages and reenter Chijgam with great fanfare and excitement. They would also hire cooks and hold extravagant celebrations and feasts. Unfortunately for Chijgamis, during the 1930s when Gandhi started his support for liquor prohibition, Taadi stores went out of business. Some Chijgamis went into Shipping business using small clipper ships. They used to transport goods between Goa, Mumbai and Bhavnagar. Advent of trucking business through roads put these families out of shipping business through sea. Farmers have now turned to grow rice, sugarcanes, mangoes & sapodillas (chikoo) Between 1930 through 1970, about 10% of children from Chijgam attended the only high school in the district: the Dahyabhai Sunderji & Bhagwanji Bhimbhai School in Khara Abrama. It is a commute of 8 miles from Chijgam to the DS&BB school. Lalbhai Patel started primary school around 1930's in Chijgam because kids had really hard time to go to Panaar which was only 3 miles commute but through muddy waterway. During the late 60’s, Chijgamis became famous for playing Kabaddi and volleyball. Chijgam sent regularly Kabaddi and volleyball teams to compete at state level. During games, Chijgam’s musical themesong, “The Pride of Chijgam” was loudly played by local bands against rival bannds during what became known as a musical face-off. The band with the loudest and clearest sound often won the battle. Chijgamis used to commute 3–6 miles to Abrama & Panar, carrying 30–35 kg of dehusked rice over their heads to convert it into puffed rice & flattened rice."

It is located along the Serranía del Perijá, covering some of the area pertaining to the valley of the Cesar River. In 1958 Codazzi was proclaimed a municipality due to its rapid population increase in the 1950s and 1960s, triggered by an agricultural boom of cotton, that attracted people searching for jobs from many departments of Colombia; mainly from Tolima, Huila, Santander, North Santander, Antioquia, Cundinamarca, Bolivar and Magdalena. When this boom ended, the agroindustry opted for other products like palm, sugar cane, liquors and milk products. In 2005 the municipality of Codazzi had approximately 52,219 inhabitants."

  "text" : "Beginning early in the 20th century, Monterrey, Mexico began a successful economic metamorphosis and growth pattern that remains an exception in Mexico. This all began with increased investments in irrigation that fueled a boom in agriculture and ranching for this northern Mexican city. The economic growth has fueled income disparity for the 3.86 million residents who live in the Monterrey Metro area (MMA). In addition, the rapid urbanization has taken a large toll on the water resources. In addressing many of this challenges, the city of Monterrey has become a model for sound and effective Integrated urban water management. The challenges that Monterrey has confronted pertain to scarcity of surface water resources, poor water quality due to untreated industrial effluents, political cycles and term-limits which can limit long-term vision, and water disputes between urban and agricultural users. Fortunately, Monterrey has good groundwater \"well-fields\" that supply about 40% of the water demand for the city and generally are not over-exploited because of good connections to high-yield aquifer systems in the central parts of the \"Curvatura de Monterrey\". These wells are managed as storage reserves that can be used in time of drought, which is quite common in this region of Mexico. Also unique to Monterrey is an arrangement made between farmers and the municipality, whereby the farmers grant the use of their water rights from the nearby Cuchillo reservoir and the municipal water utility SADM (Servicios de Agua y Drenaje de Monterrey) returns urban used and treated water to farmers for irrigation. This arrangement has benefited both parties since SADM supplements its water supply with high quality but internmitent supply from the Cuchillo reservoir and farmers receive a consistent and full of nutrients water for irrigation. The longer term outlook for the area is for urbanization to continue and water availability to decrease, therefore, new water management strategies will have to be created."

Several farms have been split up and sold to developers, resulting in an increased real estate market. Older sections of Feeding Hills, such as those closer to Line Street and Agawam High School, have remained much the same, although in recent years have experienced an exodus of businesses to other parts of town. Feeding Hills contains several churches, shopping centers, and a variety of eateries. It is home to WWLP-TV's transmitting site atop Provin Mountain (their studio has since moved to Chicopee). Agawam's police station can be found on Springfield St., one of the subsection's most populous roads. Of the 4 elementary schools and 3 md/jr/sr highs only the Junior High School and Granger Elementary, are located in \"Feeding Hills\""

Janjgir is well connected by railways and roads and is connected to major cities like Bilaspur and Raipur through National Highway 200. Every year the city organises \"Jajwalya Dev Lok Mahotsav\", a cultural programme devoted to King Jajwalya, who ruled the city in ancient times.

  "text" : "Jaisinghpur is a small town and Sub-Division in Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh, India. There is only one tehsil under Sub-Division Jaisinghpur, whish is situated at Jaisinghpur itself. Population of Jaisinghpur Town is 1,273 and overall population of Jaisinghpur Sub-Division is 58,623. It was named after the name of Katoch king of Princely ordered state Kangra-Lambagraon, Maharaja Jai Singh. It is situated on the bank of river Beas. It is known for its \"chaugan.\" There are several notable temples in the town such as Janaki Nath temple, Radhey Krishan temple near Bus Adda,Laxmi Narayan temple, Baba Mani Ram Temple, Neel Kanth Mahadev Temple, Dhudu Mahadev Mandir, Guga temple (Called Gangoti near Shitala Mata Mandir), Shitala Mata temple, a Dargah midtown, popularly known as Baba Shah Mast Ali Dargah and a Gurudwara on Jaisinghpur Lambagoan road. Shitala Mata temple is famous temple of the town on Tinbar-Palampur road. Another famous temple is Jankinath temple. There are many natural water resources in the town.'Baayein' near PWD Rest House and 'Naoun' is favorite place for all boys to have fun by swimming in summer, however it serves the major water need of people. Jaisinghpur is also famous for its vegetable production on the banks of Beas river the spot is popularly known as Bhuare ke Bagh. Once Jaisinghpur was also famous for vegetable growing on the banks of river Beas i.e. popularly known as bhuaray ka bagh. But nowadays the growing of crops including vegetables has been stopped in Jainsinghpur and entire adjoining area because of the increase of stray animals, monkeys, wild pigs, rabbits, deer’s (Kakkar, Barahsinga and neel gaye), which spoil crops completely. The menace of wild and stray animals has increased nowadays manifold probably because tigers/leopards which were responsible for keeping such animals under control have been killed by local poachers. Jaisinghpur has been also known as the first place in Kangra or perhaps in entire Himachal for staging Ramlila festival. Ramlila of Jaisinghpur started some 90 years ago and almost all the actors were Brahmin, mainly from Awasthi community. Pandit Balkishan Awasthi, a native of Jaisinghpur who lived in Mumbai for his work and also associated with theatre there, have brought all the Drama items required for Ramlila from Mumbai and started Ramlila festival single handedly at Jaisinghpur. He used to play the role of Ravana in the Ramlila and become very popular because of his dialogue delivery in strong deep voice and due to his tall, handsome personality. The uniqueness of the Ramlila was the Sanskrit language used at that time, most Ramlilas in North India are based on the 16th century Avadhi version of Ramayana, Ramcharitmanas, written by Gosvami Tulsidas entirely in verse, thus used as dialogues in most traditional versions. Jaisinghpur is also famous for its annual fair also known as holian which are celebrated in the month of march during the colour festival of holi. The Holian of Jaisinghpur are famous for its mouth watering aalu chholey and Jalebi and continues for almost a week. Holding of Kushti (wrestling) at Dargah during Holis is an annual affair watched by several visitors."

The region's economic development is also supported by the Liverpool City Region Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP), established in 2010 as the private sector-led board comprising political and business leaders from around the city region."
