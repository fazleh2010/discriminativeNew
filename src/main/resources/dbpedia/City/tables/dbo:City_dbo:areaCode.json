  "text" : "Wadapally, formerly known as Vazeerabad, is situated in Nalgonda district of Telangana, India, near Miryalaguda. Wadapally comes under the assembly constituency of Miryalaguda, this town is 24 km from Miryalaguda town. Wadapally is major producer of Cement in Nalgonda district due to the availability of lime stone across the borders of Nalgonda district and neighboring Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh. Wadapally is famous for Lord Shiva and is situated on the sangamam of River Krishna and Musi. It is accessible through bus and train from different places throughout Telangana such as Nalgonda, Miryalaguda, Hyderabad and from Andhra Pradesh such as Guntur, Nellore, Secunderabad, Tirupathi, Dachepalle. The two temples located in Wadapally are the Sri Meenakshi Agasteswara swami temple and Sri Lakshmi Narasimha swami temple. This town is located at the confluence of the Krishna and Musi rivers. The place is known for the temple of Sri Meenakshi Agasteswara Swamy which was constructed by the Kakatiya rulers in the 12th century. The significance of the temple is that there is a crevice on top of the Shivalinga which is always full of water. Even if some water is removed the original level of the water is maintained. There is no logical reason that can explain this phenomenon especially since the Shivalinga is situated about 120 metres above the water level in the river. Sri Narasimha Swamy is believed to bless the devotees with health and prosperity who pray to him soulfully.The sacred river Krishna has a very prominent place in the history of our country. Wadapally is the place where river Krishna and Musi River meet and jointly flow. Wadapally is near Vishnupuram of Nalgonda District in Dameracherla mandal and in between Bibinagar and Nadikudi Railway Stations. The coming together of these two rivers in the shape of \"L\" attract irresistibly the viewers. At the confluence of these rivers, there is a very old temple of Sri Narasimha Swamy. According to the Puranas, Vyasa Bhagavan knowing the piousness of the place, meditated for a long time for the manifestation of Sri Narasimha Swamy. Commiserating at the continued penance of Vyasa Bhagavan Lord Maha Vishnu again transfigured as Narasimha Swamy and appeared to the former, with ferocious looks of a lion. Vyasa Bhagavan experienced Lord Narasimha, who was taking breath with uncontrolled anger, coming to him just after killing Hiranyakasipu. He, therefore, entreated Sri Narasimha Swamy to manifest at Wadapally in that form only. Accordingly, Sri Narasimha Swamy manifested there to bless the devotees and to alleviate their difficulties. It is believed that even now the idol breathes in and out. The temple authorities have arranged two lamps. One of the lights of the lamp used for showing the face of the Lord will be quivering to testify the fact that the Lord is taking breath and letting it out. The light of the other lamp, which is kept below remain resolutely. There are a two mosques in vazeerabad which has historical importance. One is Masjid-E-Sara-E-Meer-Alam and second one is Qutub shahi mosque. There are many polish mills, cement and power plants are there in wadapally Surroundings.Also wadapally has Post office, Police Station, andState Bank of Hyderabad. India Cements has a Cement plant at Vishnupuram under Wadapally village limits. It is under expansion with an expenditure of Rs. 700 millions."

Situated in Nevasa taluka in Ahmednagar district, the village is known for its popular temple of Shani, the Hindu god associated with the planet (graha) Saturn. Shingnapur is 35 km from Ahmednagar city. Shingnapur is also famous for the fact that no house in the village has doors, only door frames. Despite this, no theft was reported in the village until 2010 when cash and items worth Rs. 35000/- were stolen from a vehicle, then in 2011 when Rs. 50000/-, gold rings, mobile phone, etc. was stolen from the home of a retired official of the Shree Shanaishwar Devasthan Trust  and then again in January 2012 gold ornaments were stolen from within the temple. Still villagers never keep their valuables under lock and key. The temple is believed to be a \"jagrut devasthan\" (lit. \"alive temple\"), meaning that a deity still resides in the temple icon. Villagers believe that god Shani punishes anyone attempting theft. The deity here is \"Swayambhu\" (Sanskrit: self-evolved deity) that is self emerged from earth in form of black, imposing stone. Though no one knows the exact period, it is believed that the Swayambhu Shanaishwara statue was found by shepherds of the then local hamlet. It is believed to be in existence at least since the start of Kali yuga. The village has a post office and a high school known as Shri Shanishwar Vidya Mandir besides the primary schools run by the Zilla Parishad. The chief source of water supply in the village is wells. In January 2011, the United Commercial (UCO) Bank opened a 'lockless' branch in the village, the first of its kind in the country, taking note of the near-zero crime rate in the region. The local police were reported to be unhappy over this development and that it amounted to a breach of conditions, because the Central government of India has made it mandatory for all banks to have high security.The bank has doors,but they will always remain open. However, it was reported by the local legislator and the bank officials that adequate precautions were being taken for the safety of lockers and important documents."

The rock structure has large, gaping holes in the arch and allows sunlight to enter inside which provides the required light for interiors. It was also a shelter for hunter-gatherer prehistoric people. There is a replica of Sidlaphadi in the Badami archaeological museum, it is dedicated to recreate Sidlaphadi and has posters to provide relevant information about the evolution of man.

In the early- to mid-19th century, a ditch was dug here to separate the two sections. Feeding Hills contains one quarter of the total population, as well as Provin Mountain, the highest point in the town, and many moderate-sized farms. Today, Feeding Hills is under extensive land development in and around the Provin Mountain communities. Several farms have been split up and sold to developers, resulting in an increased real estate market. Older sections of Feeding Hills, such as those closer to Line Street and Agawam High School, have remained much the same, although in recent years have experienced an exodus of businesses to other parts of town. Feeding Hills contains several churches, shopping centers, and a variety of eateries. It is home to WWLP-TV's transmitting site atop Provin Mountain (their studio has since moved to Chicopee). Agawam's police station can be found on Springfield St., one of the subsection's most populous roads. Of the 4 elementary schools and 3 md/jr/sr highs only the Junior High School and Granger Elementary, are located in \"Feeding Hills\""

  "text" : "Jaisinghpur is a small town and Sub-Division in Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh, India. There is only one tehsil under Sub-Division Jaisinghpur, whish is situated at Jaisinghpur itself. Population of Jaisinghpur Town is 1,273 and overall population of Jaisinghpur Sub-Division is 58,623. It was named after the name of Katoch king of Princely ordered state Kangra-Lambagraon, Maharaja Jai Singh. It is situated on the bank of river Beas. It is known for its \"chaugan.\" There are several notable temples in the town such as Janaki Nath temple, Radhey Krishan temple near Bus Adda,Laxmi Narayan temple, Baba Mani Ram Temple, Neel Kanth Mahadev Temple, Dhudu Mahadev Mandir, Guga temple (Called Gangoti near Shitala Mata Mandir), Shitala Mata temple, a Dargah midtown, popularly known as Baba Shah Mast Ali Dargah and a Gurudwara on Jaisinghpur Lambagoan road. Shitala Mata temple is famous temple of the town on Tinbar-Palampur road. Another famous temple is Jankinath temple. There are many natural water resources in the town.'Baayein' near PWD Rest House and 'Naoun' is favorite place for all boys to have fun by swimming in summer, however it serves the major water need of people. Jaisinghpur is also famous for its vegetable production on the banks of Beas river the spot is popularly known as Bhuare ke Bagh. Once Jaisinghpur was also famous for vegetable growing on the banks of river Beas i.e. popularly known as bhuaray ka bagh. But nowadays the growing of crops including vegetables has been stopped in Jainsinghpur and entire adjoining area because of the increase of stray animals, monkeys, wild pigs, rabbits, deer’s (Kakkar, Barahsinga and neel gaye), which spoil crops completely. The menace of wild and stray animals has increased nowadays manifold probably because tigers/leopards which were responsible for keeping such animals under control have been killed by local poachers. Jaisinghpur has been also known as the first place in Kangra or perhaps in entire Himachal for staging Ramlila festival. Ramlila of Jaisinghpur started some 90 years ago and almost all the actors were Brahmin, mainly from Awasthi community. Pandit Balkishan Awasthi, a native of Jaisinghpur who lived in Mumbai for his work and also associated with theatre there, have brought all the Drama items required for Ramlila from Mumbai and started Ramlila festival single handedly at Jaisinghpur. He used to play the role of Ravana in the Ramlila and become very popular because of his dialogue delivery in strong deep voice and due to his tall, handsome personality. The uniqueness of the Ramlila was the Sanskrit language used at that time, most Ramlilas in North India are based on the 16th century Avadhi version of Ramayana, Ramcharitmanas, written by Gosvami Tulsidas entirely in verse, thus used as dialogues in most traditional versions. Jaisinghpur is also famous for its annual fair also known as holian which are celebrated in the month of march during the colour festival of holi. The Holian of Jaisinghpur are famous for its mouth watering aalu chholey and Jalebi and continues for almost a week. Holding of Kushti (wrestling) at Dargah during Holis is an annual affair watched by several visitors."

Between Taiping and Kamunting is one of the main Military Cemeteries in Malaya. Over the many years of the conflict against the Communist terrorists, thousands of British, Australian, New Zealand, Fijian and Gurkha troops lived - and died - in and around Kamunting and Taiping. Kamunting houses the main bus station (Kamunting Raya) for Taiping town. Soon the Taiping train station will relocate there too. It has a weekly night market every Saturday night near the bus station that sells all sorts of local fresh produce and food stuffs. There are also fruit sellers along the road leading to the Kamunting bus stops which sell seasonal fruits like durian and mangosteens.
