  "text" : "Wadapally, formerly known as Vazeerabad, is situated in Nalgonda district of Telangana, India, near Miryalaguda. Wadapally comes under the assembly constituency of Miryalaguda, this town is 24 km from Miryalaguda town. Wadapally is major producer of Cement in Nalgonda district due to the availability of lime stone across the borders of Nalgonda district and neighboring Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh. Wadapally is famous for Lord Shiva and is situated on the sangamam of River Krishna and Musi. It is accessible through bus and train from different places throughout Telangana such as Nalgonda, Miryalaguda, Hyderabad and from Andhra Pradesh such as Guntur, Nellore, Secunderabad, Tirupathi, Dachepalle. The two temples located in Wadapally are the Sri Meenakshi Agasteswara swami temple and Sri Lakshmi Narasimha swami temple. This town is located at the confluence of the Krishna and Musi rivers. The place is known for the temple of Sri Meenakshi Agasteswara Swamy which was constructed by the Kakatiya rulers in the 12th century. The significance of the temple is that there is a crevice on top of the Shivalinga which is always full of water. Even if some water is removed the original level of the water is maintained. There is no logical reason that can explain this phenomenon especially since the Shivalinga is situated about 120 metres above the water level in the river. Sri Narasimha Swamy is believed to bless the devotees with health and prosperity who pray to him soulfully.The sacred river Krishna has a very prominent place in the history of our country. Wadapally is the place where river Krishna and Musi River meet and jointly flow. Wadapally is near Vishnupuram of Nalgonda District in Dameracherla mandal and in between Bibinagar and Nadikudi Railway Stations. The coming together of these two rivers in the shape of \"L\" attract irresistibly the viewers. At the confluence of these rivers, there is a very old temple of Sri Narasimha Swamy. According to the Puranas, Vyasa Bhagavan knowing the piousness of the place, meditated for a long time for the manifestation of Sri Narasimha Swamy. Commiserating at the continued penance of Vyasa Bhagavan Lord Maha Vishnu again transfigured as Narasimha Swamy and appeared to the former, with ferocious looks of a lion. Vyasa Bhagavan experienced Lord Narasimha, who was taking breath with uncontrolled anger, coming to him just after killing Hiranyakasipu. He, therefore, entreated Sri Narasimha Swamy to manifest at Wadapally in that form only. Accordingly, Sri Narasimha Swamy manifested there to bless the devotees and to alleviate their difficulties. It is believed that even now the idol breathes in and out. The temple authorities have arranged two lamps. One of the lights of the lamp used for showing the face of the Lord will be quivering to testify the fact that the Lord is taking breath and letting it out. The light of the other lamp, which is kept below remain resolutely. There are a two mosques in vazeerabad which has historical importance. One is Masjid-E-Sara-E-Meer-Alam and second one is Qutub shahi mosque. There are many polish mills, cement and power plants are there in wadapally Surroundings.Also wadapally has Post office, Police Station, andState Bank of Hyderabad. India Cements has a Cement plant at Vishnupuram under Wadapally village limits. It is under expansion with an expenditure of Rs. 700 millions."

These inns are called \"Serai\", hence Naurang got its prefix as Serai Naurang. The town is commercially located between the districts of Bannu, Karak, Frontier Region of Bannu and Lakki Marwat.

  "text" : "Shani Shingnapur or Shani Shinganapur or Shani (Marathi: शनी शिंगणापुर )or Shingnapur or Sonai (Marathi: सोनाई) is a village in the Indian state of Maharashtra. Situated in Nevasa taluka in Ahmednagar district, the village is known for its popular temple of Shani, the Hindu god associated with the planet (graha) Saturn. Shingnapur is 35 km from Ahmednagar city. Shingnapur is also famous for the fact that no house in the village has doors, only door frames. Despite this, no theft was reported in the village until 2010 when cash and items worth Rs. 35000/- were stolen from a vehicle, then in 2011 when Rs. 50000/-, gold rings, mobile phone, etc. was stolen from the home of a retired official of the Shree Shanaishwar Devasthan Trust  and then again in January 2012 gold ornaments were stolen from within the temple. Still villagers never keep their valuables under lock and key. The temple is believed to be a \"jagrut devasthan\" (lit. \"alive temple\"), meaning that a deity still resides in the temple icon. Villagers believe that god Shani punishes anyone attempting theft. The deity here is \"Swayambhu\" (Sanskrit: self-evolved deity) that is self emerged from earth in form of black, imposing stone. Though no one knows the exact period, it is believed that the Swayambhu Shanaishwara statue was found by shepherds of the then local hamlet. It is believed to be in existence at least since the start of Kali yuga. The village has a post office and a high school known as Shri Shanishwar Vidya Mandir besides the primary schools run by the Zilla Parishad. The chief source of water supply in the village is wells. In January 2011, the United Commercial (UCO) Bank opened a 'lockless' branch in the village, the first of its kind in the country, taking note of the near-zero crime rate in the region. The local police were reported to be unhappy over this development and that it amounted to a breach of conditions, because the Central government of India has made it mandatory for all banks to have high security.The bank has doors,but they will always remain open. However, it was reported by the local legislator and the bank officials that adequate precautions were being taken for the safety of lockers and important documents."

Sidlaphadi literally means in Kannada the Rock of lightning, derived from gaping holes in the natural rock arch, which was formed when a lightning struck.The natural rock bridge structure looks like a wide arch between two sandstone boulders (served as a roof). The rock structure has large, gaping holes in the arch and allows sunlight to enter inside which provides the required light for interiors. It was also a shelter for hunter-gatherer prehistoric people. There is a replica of Sidlaphadi in the Badami archaeological museum, it is dedicated to recreate Sidlaphadi and has posters to provide relevant information about the evolution of man. There are evidences to prove that the Sidlaphadi was a dwelling of prehistoric man."

  "text" : "Seutula (Swedish: Sjöskog) is a district in Vantaa, Finland, located inside the curve of the River Vantaa. Seutula is also a village in the medieval town of Helsinki, stretching to Rajakoski in the north, Lavanko in the east covering the whole district of Kiila, and including Sotilaskorpi in the south. On the other hand, the western part of the river's curve, including the Königstedt manor, belongs to the village of Riipilä. Seutula is often considered a region stretching even outside the official district, and it has an active local community. In terms of government, Seutula, Riipilä, and Kiila belong to the Kivistö major district. In the early 1950s, a new airfield for Helsinki was built along the Seutulantie road, stretching from Tuusulantie in Ruskeasanta to Seutula. This airfield was opened in 1952, and became the Helsinki Airport in 1977. Already during its construction, the airfield was commonly called the Seutula airfield, because Tuusulantie had a sign pointing to Seutula. In reality, the airfield was built about 8 kilometres southeast from Seutula, in the northern parts of Veromiehenkylä and Kirkonkylä. Nowadays, Lentokenttä (Finnish for \"airfield\") is its own district in Vantaa. The name Seutula is often connected to prisons, although there never has been a prison in Seutula. The reason for the connection is that the airfield was mainly built using prisoner labour. Some of the prisoners used to build the airfield were public figures of the 1960s, convicted of driving under influence, bringing the activity to light. An open prison was located in Seutula until 2009. This prison was originally called a labour colony, and one of its inmates in the 1960s was Irwin Goodman, who had made records about the subject called Terveisiä Seutulasta (\"greetings from Seutula\") and Autolla Kanarian saarille (\"to the Canary Islands by car\"), with lyrics by Vexi Salmi."

A Sonia Vihar power plant is recently being built in Bhjanpura. There are few major attractions in this location, but it is a well-suited area because of the nearby interstate bus terminal, railway station and educational institutions like Lal Bhadur Shastri college affiliated with Delhi University 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) from there and Northern Indian Engineering college affiliated with I.P. University is also 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) from there. The main landmark of Bhajanpura is Bhajanpura Chowk, which is very busy all time. There are various blocks in Bhajanpura such as A,B,C,D etc. and every street is given a number. Unlike its neighborhood Yamuna VIhar , Bhajanpura is not well planned with no parks at all making it a congested place. Interesting fact is that Bhajanpura is actually Block A of Yamuna Vihar (as per the locals)."

  "text" : "Chijgam was established around 1850 by Makanbhai Patel and few other families who migrated from Mutwaad. Chijgam and all of its neighboring villages were massive sea salt producing areas for almost 200 years. The area that Chijgam is located on is separated from the Arabian Sea by approximately one mile of land. It is located on Kanai Creek which starts from Toli Talav, north of Navsari and ends up at Arabian Sea. Salt was mainly traded from the Chijgamis to the Banjaras/Vanzaras (gujrati pronunciation) (the gypsy tribe of traders) for money, materials, essentials, food, and jewelry. Eventually technology advanced, and ships were used to transport salt to Mumbai. Adoption of a railroad transportation system replaced Chijgami dependence on the Vanzaras and their camel fleets. Introduction of a fresh water canal system reduced the amount of salt in the sea (brine level) by 40%. The lack of salt eventually ended the salt business that Chijgam was accustomed to. However, canals were useful in rejuvenating farm crops and mango orchards. Despite the demise of the salt manufacturing business, the improvement of the land’s agriculture is why canals were still used. By 1975, opportunities in the diamond cutting and polishing businesses brought prosperity back to Chijgam. Meanwhile, people started to immigrate to Europe and North America. Today Canada and the Persian Gulf have one of the largest number of residents from Chijgam. Dandi is the place where Gandhi concluded his salt march in 1930. Chijgam is located 7–8 miles from Dandi and share the area of salt manufacturing farms with Dandi. Gandhi also visited Mutwaad, Abrama, Panaar while he stayed for one month before his arrest. From the 1920s through the 1940s, several Chijgami residents flourished in the Toddy also known as Palm wine, (a semi-alcoholic drink made from the sap of Palm trees) producing and selling business. Toddy can also be distilled and it is known as arrack everywhere. These Chijgamis traveled as far as Nagpur to run such stores and during the festival of Diwali, would return to Chijgam with great wealth. However, before returning to Chijgam, many of the businessmen would hire musicians from neighboring villages and reenter Chijgam with great fanfare and excitement. They would also hire cooks and hold extravagant celebrations and feasts. Unfortunately for Chijgamis, during the 1930s when Gandhi started his support for liquor prohibition, Taadi stores went out of business. Some Chijgamis went into Shipping business using small clipper ships. They used to transport goods between Goa, Mumbai and Bhavnagar. Advent of trucking business through roads put these families out of shipping business through sea. Farmers have now turned to grow rice, sugarcanes, mangoes & sapodillas (chikoo) Between 1930 through 1970, about 10% of children from Chijgam attended the only high school in the district: the Dahyabhai Sunderji & Bhagwanji Bhimbhai School in Khara Abrama. It is a commute of 8 miles from Chijgam to the DS&BB school. Lalbhai Patel started primary school around 1930's in Chijgam because kids had really hard time to go to Panaar which was only 3 miles commute but through muddy waterway. During the late 60’s, Chijgamis became famous for playing Kabaddi and volleyball. Chijgam sent regularly Kabaddi and volleyball teams to compete at state level. During games, Chijgam’s musical themesong, “The Pride of Chijgam” was loudly played by local bands against rival bannds during what became known as a musical face-off. The band with the loudest and clearest sound often won the battle. Chijgamis used to commute 3–6 miles to Abrama & Panar, carrying 30–35 kg of dehusked rice over their heads to convert it into puffed rice & flattened rice."

Feeding Hills contains one quarter of the total population, as well as Provin Mountain, the highest point in the town, and many moderate-sized farms. Today, Feeding Hills is under extensive land development in and around the Provin Mountain communities. Several farms have been split up and sold to developers, resulting in an increased real estate market. Older sections of Feeding Hills, such as those closer to Line Street and Agawam High School, have remained much the same, although in recent years have experienced an exodus of businesses to other parts of town. Feeding Hills contains several churches, shopping centers, and a variety of eateries. It is home to WWLP-TV's transmitting site atop Provin Mountain (their studio has since moved to Chicopee). Agawam's police station can be found on Springfield St., one of the subsection's most populous roads.

Punta Mita is surrounded on three sides by nine and a half miles of Pacific Ocean beaches and coves including Litibu Bay. Punta Mita is at the same latitude as the Hawaiian Islands. It is kept comfortable year round by gentle sea breezes, with average summer temperatures around 85 °F (29 °C), and 75 °F (24 °C) during winter months. Because of its temperate, tropical climate, Punta Mita is a popular but low-key vacation spot. Hollywood celebrities such as Kylie Jenner, Kendall Jenner, Tyga Demi Moore, Orlando Bloom and Vince Vaughn have vacationed at Casa Aramara in Punta Mita, a private resort built by Joe Francis. Billionaire Thomas Siebel has also visited the village. Punta Mita has several residential communities ranging from condominiums and townhomes to private, single-family villas. All of these homes set among a rural Mexican fishing colony town. It is also the location of the Four Seasons Resort, Punta Mita as well as the St. Regis Resort, Punta Mita. The Marieta Islands are a 15-minute boat ride from Punta Mita and are a Mexican national park."

There is only one tehsil under Sub-Division Jaisinghpur, whish is situated at Jaisinghpur itself. Population of Jaisinghpur Town is 1,273 and overall population of Jaisinghpur Sub-Division is 58,623. It was named after the name of Katoch king of Princely ordered state Kangra-Lambagraon, Maharaja Jai Singh. It is situated on the bank of river Beas. It is known for its \"chaugan.\" There are several notable temples in the town such as Janaki Nath temple, Radhey Krishan temple near Bus Adda,Laxmi Narayan temple, Baba Mani Ram Temple, Neel Kanth Mahadev Temple, Dhudu Mahadev Mandir, Guga temple (Called Gangoti near Shitala Mata Mandir), Shitala Mata temple, a Dargah midtown, popularly known as Baba Shah Mast Ali Dargah and a Gurudwara on Jaisinghpur Lambagoan road. Shitala Mata temple is famous temple of the town on Tinbar-Palampur road. Another famous temple is Jankinath temple. There are many natural water resources in the town.'Baayein' near PWD Rest House and 'Naoun' is favorite place for all boys to have fun by swimming in summer, however it serves the major water need of people. Jaisinghpur is also famous for its vegetable production on the banks of Beas river the spot is popularly known as Bhuare ke Bagh. Once Jaisinghpur was also famous for vegetable growing on the banks of river Beas i.e. popularly known as bhuaray ka bagh. But nowadays the growing of crops including vegetables has been stopped in Jainsinghpur and entire adjoining area because of the increase of stray animals, monkeys, wild pigs, rabbits, deer’s (Kakkar, Barahsinga and neel gaye), which spoil crops completely. The menace of wild and stray animals has increased nowadays manifold probably because tigers/leopards which were responsible for keeping such animals under control have been killed by local poachers. Jaisinghpur has been also known as the first place in Kangra or perhaps in entire Himachal for staging Ramlila festival. Ramlila of Jaisinghpur started some 90 years ago and almost all the actors were Brahmin, mainly from Awasthi community. Pandit Balkishan Awasthi, a native of Jaisinghpur who lived in Mumbai for his work and also associated with theatre there, have brought all the Drama items required for Ramlila from Mumbai and started Ramlila festival single handedly at Jaisinghpur. He used to play the role of Ravana in the Ramlila and become very popular because of his dialogue delivery in strong deep voice and due to his tall, handsome personality. The uniqueness of the Ramlila was the Sanskrit language used at that time, most Ramlilas in North India are based on the 16th century Avadhi version of Ramayana, Ramcharitmanas, written by Gosvami Tulsidas entirely in verse, thus used as dialogues in most traditional versions. Jaisinghpur is also famous for its annual fair also known as holian which are celebrated in the month of march during the colour festival of holi. The Holian of Jaisinghpur are famous for its mouth watering aalu chholey and Jalebi and continues for almost a week. Holding of Kushti (wrestling) at Dargah during Holis is an annual affair watched by several visitors."

It has all the basic amenities maintained to a sufficiently pleasing level to meet the demands of the residents. Children's playgrounds, parks and parking lots are present in each of its blocks. Residents from here usually shop from the markets located in Bhajanpura. Yamuna Vihar is a major educational hub for north east Delhi. It has Bhim Rao Ambedkar College of Delhi University, Aakriti School of English Language Near C-12 Market and Bachpan Playway School near DESU office.

Some of the parks are dedicated to the usage of women (e.g. Mahila Park) and old age people. These parks do play a big role in making Yamuna Vihar a green and beautiful area.There is proper Police patrolling and monitoring in the area.Amongst its nearby areas, Yamuna Vihar is the only well-planned locality. Transportation from Yamua Vihar to Yamuna river crossing is messed up and need to be improved.

The upcoming Delhi Metro project will also improve this situation.It has many restaurants like the yellow chilli, Pizza Diet, Giani's, Basinghey etc. in and around it. The main road of yamuna vihar falls into commercial property."
