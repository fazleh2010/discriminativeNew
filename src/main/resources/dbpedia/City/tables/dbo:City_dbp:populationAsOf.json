  "text" : "Wadapally, formerly known as Vazeerabad, is situated in Nalgonda district of Telangana, India, near Miryalaguda. Wadapally comes under the assembly constituency of Miryalaguda, this town is 24 km from Miryalaguda town. Wadapally is major producer of Cement in Nalgonda district due to the availability of lime stone across the borders of Nalgonda district and neighboring Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh. Wadapally is famous for Lord Shiva and is situated on the sangamam of River Krishna and Musi. It is accessible through bus and train from different places throughout Telangana such as Nalgonda, Miryalaguda, Hyderabad and from Andhra Pradesh such as Guntur, Nellore, Secunderabad, Tirupathi, Dachepalle. The two temples located in Wadapally are the Sri Meenakshi Agasteswara swami temple and Sri Lakshmi Narasimha swami temple. This town is located at the confluence of the Krishna and Musi rivers. The place is known for the temple of Sri Meenakshi Agasteswara Swamy which was constructed by the Kakatiya rulers in the 12th century. The significance of the temple is that there is a crevice on top of the Shivalinga which is always full of water. Even if some water is removed the original level of the water is maintained. There is no logical reason that can explain this phenomenon especially since the Shivalinga is situated about 120 metres above the water level in the river. Sri Narasimha Swamy is believed to bless the devotees with health and prosperity who pray to him soulfully.The sacred river Krishna has a very prominent place in the history of our country. Wadapally is the place where river Krishna and Musi River meet and jointly flow. Wadapally is near Vishnupuram of Nalgonda District in Dameracherla mandal and in between Bibinagar and Nadikudi Railway Stations. The coming together of these two rivers in the shape of \"L\" attract irresistibly the viewers. At the confluence of these rivers, there is a very old temple of Sri Narasimha Swamy. According to the Puranas, Vyasa Bhagavan knowing the piousness of the place, meditated for a long time for the manifestation of Sri Narasimha Swamy. Commiserating at the continued penance of Vyasa Bhagavan Lord Maha Vishnu again transfigured as Narasimha Swamy and appeared to the former, with ferocious looks of a lion. Vyasa Bhagavan experienced Lord Narasimha, who was taking breath with uncontrolled anger, coming to him just after killing Hiranyakasipu. He, therefore, entreated Sri Narasimha Swamy to manifest at Wadapally in that form only. Accordingly, Sri Narasimha Swamy manifested there to bless the devotees and to alleviate their difficulties. It is believed that even now the idol breathes in and out. The temple authorities have arranged two lamps. One of the lights of the lamp used for showing the face of the Lord will be quivering to testify the fact that the Lord is taking breath and letting it out. The light of the other lamp, which is kept below remain resolutely. There are a two mosques in vazeerabad which has historical importance. One is Masjid-E-Sara-E-Meer-Alam and second one is Qutub shahi mosque. There are many polish mills, cement and power plants are there in wadapally Surroundings.Also wadapally has Post office, Police Station, andState Bank of Hyderabad. India Cements has a Cement plant at Vishnupuram under Wadapally village limits. It is under expansion with an expenditure of Rs. 700 millions."

The town derived its name, as legend goes, from one Mr. Naurang Khan Gandhapur, whose family has landed holding in the town. The prefix is supposed to added in the era of English rule in the 18th century when they established camping grounds/ inns on each 15 miles of roads as resting place for the movements of their infantry. These inns are called \"Serai\", hence Naurang got its prefix as Serai Naurang. The town is commercially located between the districts of Bannu, Karak, Frontier Region of Bannu and Lakki Marwat. It caters to the needs of adjacent districts for vegetables, fruit, rice, oil, wheat, flour, household goods and grocery. It is hub for various fruits like orange, watermelon from Punjab province, MashMelon, pomegranate and grapes from Afghanistan, apple from FATA, peach, pear and persimmon ('amlok' in Pashtu, 'D.kaki' in Japanese) from Peshawer. It is famous for weekly Market arranged on every Thursday especially for cattle exchange and weekly supply of food items for the people of peripheral areas.سرائے means inn نو means(new) رنگ means (colour) so serai naurang means (new colour inn) ."

  "text" : "Seutula (Swedish: Sjöskog) is a district in Vantaa, Finland, located inside the curve of the River Vantaa. Seutula is also a village in the medieval town of Helsinki, stretching to Rajakoski in the north, Lavanko in the east covering the whole district of Kiila, and including Sotilaskorpi in the south. On the other hand, the western part of the river's curve, including the Königstedt manor, belongs to the village of Riipilä. Seutula is often considered a region stretching even outside the official district, and it has an active local community. In terms of government, Seutula, Riipilä, and Kiila belong to the Kivistö major district. In the early 1950s, a new airfield for Helsinki was built along the Seutulantie road, stretching from Tuusulantie in Ruskeasanta to Seutula. This airfield was opened in 1952, and became the Helsinki Airport in 1977. Already during its construction, the airfield was commonly called the Seutula airfield, because Tuusulantie had a sign pointing to Seutula. In reality, the airfield was built about 8 kilometres southeast from Seutula, in the northern parts of Veromiehenkylä and Kirkonkylä. Nowadays, Lentokenttä (Finnish for \"airfield\") is its own district in Vantaa. The name Seutula is often connected to prisons, although there never has been a prison in Seutula. The reason for the connection is that the airfield was mainly built using prisoner labour. Some of the prisoners used to build the airfield were public figures of the 1960s, convicted of driving under influence, bringing the activity to light. An open prison was located in Seutula until 2009. This prison was originally called a labour colony, and one of its inmates in the 1960s was Irwin Goodman, who had made records about the subject called Terveisiä Seutulasta (\"greetings from Seutula\") and Autolla Kanarian saarille (\"to the Canary Islands by car\"), with lyrics by Vexi Salmi."

  "text" : "Chijgam was established around 1850 by Makanbhai Patel and few other families who migrated from Mutwaad. Chijgam and all of its neighboring villages were massive sea salt producing areas for almost 200 years. The area that Chijgam is located on is separated from the Arabian Sea by approximately one mile of land. It is located on Kanai Creek which starts from Toli Talav, north of Navsari and ends up at Arabian Sea. Salt was mainly traded from the Chijgamis to the Banjaras/Vanzaras (gujrati pronunciation) (the gypsy tribe of traders) for money, materials, essentials, food, and jewelry. Eventually technology advanced, and ships were used to transport salt to Mumbai. Adoption of a railroad transportation system replaced Chijgami dependence on the Vanzaras and their camel fleets. Introduction of a fresh water canal system reduced the amount of salt in the sea (brine level) by 40%. The lack of salt eventually ended the salt business that Chijgam was accustomed to. However, canals were useful in rejuvenating farm crops and mango orchards. Despite the demise of the salt manufacturing business, the improvement of the land’s agriculture is why canals were still used. By 1975, opportunities in the diamond cutting and polishing businesses brought prosperity back to Chijgam. Meanwhile, people started to immigrate to Europe and North America. Today Canada and the Persian Gulf have one of the largest number of residents from Chijgam. Dandi is the place where Gandhi concluded his salt march in 1930. Chijgam is located 7–8 miles from Dandi and share the area of salt manufacturing farms with Dandi. Gandhi also visited Mutwaad, Abrama, Panaar while he stayed for one month before his arrest. From the 1920s through the 1940s, several Chijgami residents flourished in the Toddy also known as Palm wine, (a semi-alcoholic drink made from the sap of Palm trees) producing and selling business. Toddy can also be distilled and it is known as arrack everywhere. These Chijgamis traveled as far as Nagpur to run such stores and during the festival of Diwali, would return to Chijgam with great wealth. However, before returning to Chijgam, many of the businessmen would hire musicians from neighboring villages and reenter Chijgam with great fanfare and excitement. They would also hire cooks and hold extravagant celebrations and feasts. Unfortunately for Chijgamis, during the 1930s when Gandhi started his support for liquor prohibition, Taadi stores went out of business. Some Chijgamis went into Shipping business using small clipper ships. They used to transport goods between Goa, Mumbai and Bhavnagar. Advent of trucking business through roads put these families out of shipping business through sea. Farmers have now turned to grow rice, sugarcanes, mangoes & sapodillas (chikoo) Between 1930 through 1970, about 10% of children from Chijgam attended the only high school in the district: the Dahyabhai Sunderji & Bhagwanji Bhimbhai School in Khara Abrama. It is a commute of 8 miles from Chijgam to the DS&BB school. Lalbhai Patel started primary school around 1930's in Chijgam because kids had really hard time to go to Panaar which was only 3 miles commute but through muddy waterway. During the late 60’s, Chijgamis became famous for playing Kabaddi and volleyball. Chijgam sent regularly Kabaddi and volleyball teams to compete at state level. During games, Chijgam’s musical themesong, “The Pride of Chijgam” was loudly played by local bands against rival bannds during what became known as a musical face-off. The band with the loudest and clearest sound often won the battle. Chijgamis used to commute 3–6 miles to Abrama & Panar, carrying 30–35 kg of dehusked rice over their heads to convert it into puffed rice & flattened rice."

It is located along the Serranía del Perijá, covering some of the area pertaining to the valley of the Cesar River. In 1958 Codazzi was proclaimed a municipality due to its rapid population increase in the 1950s and 1960s, triggered by an agricultural boom of cotton, that attracted people searching for jobs from many departments of Colombia; mainly from Tolima, Huila, Santander, North Santander, Antioquia, Cundinamarca, Bolivar and Magdalena. When this boom ended, the agroindustry opted for other products like palm, sugar cane, liquors and milk products. In 2005 the municipality of Codazzi had approximately 52,219 inhabitants."

  "text" : "Beginning early in the 20th century, Monterrey, Mexico began a successful economic metamorphosis and growth pattern that remains an exception in Mexico. This all began with increased investments in irrigation that fueled a boom in agriculture and ranching for this northern Mexican city. The economic growth has fueled income disparity for the 3.86 million residents who live in the Monterrey Metro area (MMA). In addition, the rapid urbanization has taken a large toll on the water resources. In addressing many of this challenges, the city of Monterrey has become a model for sound and effective Integrated urban water management. The challenges that Monterrey has confronted pertain to scarcity of surface water resources, poor water quality due to untreated industrial effluents, political cycles and term-limits which can limit long-term vision, and water disputes between urban and agricultural users. Fortunately, Monterrey has good groundwater \"well-fields\" that supply about 40% of the water demand for the city and generally are not over-exploited because of good connections to high-yield aquifer systems in the central parts of the \"Curvatura de Monterrey\". These wells are managed as storage reserves that can be used in time of drought, which is quite common in this region of Mexico. Also unique to Monterrey is an arrangement made between farmers and the municipality, whereby the farmers grant the use of their water rights from the nearby Cuchillo reservoir and the municipal water utility SADM (Servicios de Agua y Drenaje de Monterrey) returns urban used and treated water to farmers for irrigation. This arrangement has benefited both parties since SADM supplements its water supply with high quality but internmitent supply from the Cuchillo reservoir and farmers receive a consistent and full of nutrients water for irrigation. The longer term outlook for the area is for urbanization to continue and water availability to decrease, therefore, new water management strategies will have to be created."

With the view of transferring population from densely populated regions of Bihar & Northern Provinces( Uttar Pradesh to waste lands/jungles of Burma, the British Government offered large tracts of land in Burma by way of Grants,to big Indian Zamindars & Princely States to take up the migration work. Invitations were sent to the Maharaja of Dumraon as well as to the Dewan of Dumraon State. While the Maharaja declined the offer, Dewan Jai Prakash Lall C.I.E. accepted the offer and was granted 18340 acres of land in Zayawadi region in Myanmar by the British Empire. Dewan Jai Prakash Lall C.I.E. & his son Rai Bahadur Harihar Prasad Singh took neighboring people from Bihar & Northern Provinces to Myanmar and let them cut and clean the forest in that land and allowed them to grow paddy & sugar cane to earn living. In 1934-35 a sugar mill, bought from Britain was set up by Rai Bahadur Harihar Prasad Singh & his son, Mr. Chandradeva Prakash Sinha. The mill had a capacity of 1000 tons per year initially, which was expanded to 2,500 tons before the second World War. The mill was the largest sugar mill in Burma of the time. New machinery was also bought during the war days to further expand capacity. The sugar factory had been running till 1952-53. In 1954 the mill was nationalized by the Myanmar Government and the factory was run by the Government thereafter."

  "text" : "Feeding Hills is a subsection of the town of Agawam with its own zip code (01030) and post office. Line Street in Agawam is generally accepted by residents as being the pseudo-border. In the early- to mid-19th century, a ditch was dug here to separate the two sections. Feeding Hills contains one quarter of the total population, as well as Provin Mountain, the highest point in the town, and many moderate-sized farms. Today, Feeding Hills is under extensive land development in and around the Provin Mountain communities. Several farms have been split up and sold to developers, resulting in an increased real estate market. Older sections of Feeding Hills, such as those closer to Line Street and Agawam High School, have remained much the same, although in recent years have experienced an exodus of businesses to other parts of town. Feeding Hills contains several churches, shopping centers, and a variety of eateries. It is home to WWLP-TV's transmitting site atop Provin Mountain (their studio has since moved to Chicopee). Agawam's police station can be found on Springfield St., one of the subsection's most populous roads. Of the 4 elementary schools and 3 md/jr/sr highs only the Junior High School and Granger Elementary, are located in \"Feeding Hills\""

There is only one tehsil under Sub-Division Jaisinghpur, whish is situated at Jaisinghpur itself. Population of Jaisinghpur Town is 1,273 and overall population of Jaisinghpur Sub-Division is 58,623. It was named after the name of Katoch king of Princely ordered state Kangra-Lambagraon, Maharaja Jai Singh. It is situated on the bank of river Beas. It is known for its \"chaugan.\" There are several notable temples in the town such as Janaki Nath temple, Radhey Krishan temple near Bus Adda,Laxmi Narayan temple, Baba Mani Ram Temple, Neel Kanth Mahadev Temple, Dhudu Mahadev Mandir, Guga temple (Called Gangoti near Shitala Mata Mandir), Shitala Mata temple, a Dargah midtown, popularly known as Baba Shah Mast Ali Dargah and a Gurudwara on Jaisinghpur Lambagoan road. Shitala Mata temple is famous temple of the town on Tinbar-Palampur road. Another famous temple is Jankinath temple. There are many natural water resources in the town.'Baayein' near PWD Rest House and 'Naoun' is favorite place for all boys to have fun by swimming in summer, however it serves the major water need of people. Jaisinghpur is also famous for its vegetable production on the banks of Beas river the spot is popularly known as Bhuare ke Bagh. Once Jaisinghpur was also famous for vegetable growing on the banks of river Beas i.e. popularly known as bhuaray ka bagh. But nowadays the growing of crops including vegetables has been stopped in Jainsinghpur and entire adjoining area because of the increase of stray animals, monkeys, wild pigs, rabbits, deer’s (Kakkar, Barahsinga and neel gaye), which spoil crops completely. The menace of wild and stray animals has increased nowadays manifold probably because tigers/leopards which were responsible for keeping such animals under control have been killed by local poachers. Jaisinghpur has been also known as the first place in Kangra or perhaps in entire Himachal for staging Ramlila festival. Ramlila of Jaisinghpur started some 90 years ago and almost all the actors were Brahmin, mainly from Awasthi community. Pandit Balkishan Awasthi, a native of Jaisinghpur who lived in Mumbai for his work and also associated with theatre there, have brought all the Drama items required for Ramlila from Mumbai and started Ramlila festival single handedly at Jaisinghpur. He used to play the role of Ravana in the Ramlila and become very popular because of his dialogue delivery in strong deep voice and due to his tall, handsome personality. The uniqueness of the Ramlila was the Sanskrit language used at that time, most Ramlilas in North India are based on the 16th century Avadhi version of Ramayana, Ramcharitmanas, written by Gosvami Tulsidas entirely in verse, thus used as dialogues in most traditional versions. Jaisinghpur is also famous for its annual fair also known as holian which are celebrated in the month of march during the colour festival of holi. The Holian of Jaisinghpur are famous for its mouth watering aalu chholey and Jalebi and continues for almost a week. Holding of Kushti (wrestling) at Dargah during Holis is an annual affair watched by several visitors."

  "text" : "Nguroje is a town found on the mambilla plateau,in Sardauna Local Government Area of Taraba State in eastern Nigeria.It is easy to see that the term \"Nguroje\" is an original rendering in Fulfulde (Fulani) language, derived from \"Ngu-ram\", meaning economic income. Thus, \"Ngu-ro-je\" (economic enclaves) is a plural of \"Ngu-ro-re\" (an economic enclave). The straight-away translation of the term \"Nguroje\" in English language is \"Living Springs\". \"Guroji\" is a non-Fulfulde rendering, perhaps by certain tribes that later came to settle in the town with the original Fulbe founders of the town.History of NgurojeOld Mbungnu (Mbungnu, Kwuo, Guroji, Nguroje) Old Mbungnu (Kwuo or Kwu-Mbungnu) was the cradle of the Mbunip and Magu clans of Mambilla down to about 1890 before they separated from here. Some “Kobira” came at the beginning of the British administration and settled on the abandoned Mbungnu site, obviously a little before the Hausa man, Musa Bichi, arrived at the camp. The kobiras were former abductees, majority of whom had escaped from their abductors after the Anglo-German War at Banyo of 1915. A few however came a few years before 1915. In the “Kobira” section, the Ward headship followed no specific line. The first Ward Head was one ‘Hamajulde’ who died in 1935. Then, ‘Dika Pullo’ became Ward Head in 1937 and died 1939. ‘Dika Pullo’ came from Tibati. Like most “Kobira”, neither his ancestry nor that of Hamajulde is ascertained. The next Ward Head was Barde, said by some to have been indigenous. He took over rulership in 1940. The Kobira, because of their “detention” or “incarceration” outside their homelands, usually lost their culture and became “elements of no culture”. They commonly betrayed their roots, in many instances pretending to be allies of their own erstwhile tormentors. Many of these Kobiras were simply those who mixed with Fulanis in their sojourning and tended to behave like Fulanis. This is not to show that all the existing inhabitants of Kwu-Mbungnu were by 1915 all Kobira. There were indeed remnants of the pre-existing Kwu-Mbungnu people who were erroneously classed with the Kobira.Hausa traders also pitched their tents at Kwu-Mbungnu on the ruins (“Guroji” = “ruins”) at the end German rule (c.1915) and inception of British suzerainty. The first itinerant Hausa traders then included he aforementioned Musa Bichi from Bichi of Kano, who was based in Garbabi and used to travel through Mambilla to Bamenda for trading just before the end of German rule. Under the British, he finally relocated from Garbabi to Old Mbungnu possibly in the late 1920s. He became the first Hausa to settle here at Old Mbungnu site. Musa Bichi of Kano thus became the first of the Hausa-settler trading colony that met the Kobira on the ruins of Kwu-Mbungnu. He was born and bred in Bichi near Kano and became the first Sarkin Hausawa (Ward Head) of the Hausa trading section of Kwu-Mbungnu, later called “Guroji”, Fulani term for ‘ruined town’ (a name used, until much later, exclusively by the newcomers at that time). Musa Bichi was the first head of only the Hausa section and was still Ward Head by 1932 (1938 I.R). By that year, there was no Fulani ward or head in the camp, the rare visiting graziers being noticed only in bush grass shacks.When the cattle selling point was first set up here by the British in about 1927, more and more Hausa traders and Fulani cattle sellers were attracted in the 1930s, more so by the opportunity provided by the opening in 1926 of the Government-organized Trade Route through Mambilla to Bamenda.In 2005, Kwu-Mbungnu (with the “Guroje” misnomer) was made one of 20 districts created by the 2005 Order. Historically, it had been the territorial jurisdiction of the Mbon Mbunibi (Chief of Mbunip) and the 1938 Intelligence Report suggested its subsequent return to the Chief of Mbunip."

  "text" : "Tacuba is a section of northwest Mexico City. It sits on the site of ancient Tlacopan. Tacuba was an autonomous municipality until 1928, when it was incorporated into the Central Department along with the municipalities of Mexico, Tacubaya and Mixcoac. The Central Department was later split up into boroughs (delegaciones); historical Tacuba is now in the borough of Miguel Hidalgo. The area was designated as a \"Barrio Mágico\" by the city in 2011. Tacuba was called Tlacopan in the pre-Hispanic period. Tacuba is derived from the former Nahuatl name \"Tlacopan\" and means place of the jarilla plant. It was conquered by Azcapotzalco which placed Totoquihuatzin as governor. When the Tenochtitlan and Texcoco decided to ally against Azcapotzalco, Tlacopan did not resist and for this reason is considered to be the third of the Aztec Triple Alliance. Tacuba’s importance led to the construction of a causeway over the lake linking it with Tenochtitlan. Today, this causeway still exists as a major thoroughfare called Calzada Mexico-Tacuba. During the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, the Aztecs succeeded at one point in expelling the Spanish from Tenochtitlan in an event called La Noche Triste (The Sad Night). Cortés and his men fled towards Tacuba on the road that still connects it with the historic center of Mexico City. One year later, Cortés returned to Tenochtitlan to conquer it for good. At the intersection of the Mexico-Tacuba Road and Mar Blanco is a still surviving Montezuma cypress tree. According to legend, this is the tree under which Cortés wept. The last ruler of Tacuba was Tetlepanquetzal, who was tortured by Cortés, who suspected that he was hiding treasure. Over the pre-Hispanic ceremonial site, the Franciscans constructed a church dedicate to the Archangel Gabriel. By 1632, the area had sixty haciendas and by the end of the 18th century, 28 villages with Tacuba proper having twelve neighborhoods. The main river through here was the Remedios, which was the main supply of water. In addition, to agriculture, the area was also an important supplier of lumber and sandstone for construction. By 1794, the area had 45 villages. In the first third of the 20th century, three important schools were established in Tacuba. The Colegio Militar was moved to Popotla in 1913, closed during the Mexican Revolution and reopend in 1920. The Escuela Nacional de Maestros (National Teachers College) was opened in 1925 along with the Escuela de Medicina Veterinaria de UNAM. In 1937, the Instituto Politécnico Nacional was opened in Santo Tómas. Since the mid 20th century, Tacuba proper has declined with problems such as crime and sanitation issues. Tacuba has major problems with uncontrolled street vending and public transportation, prostitution and other crime. Rehabilitation of Tacuba is under a program designated RENACE (rebirth) . The church and former monastery of San Gabriel is located next to the Tacuba Metro station. The main entrance to the atrium has a stone gate with three arches. The small atrium is mostly paved with a few trees. The façade is mostly Baroque with the portal marked the two grooved Doric columns and topped by a frieze with vegetative design done in relief. It has one bell tower with two levels also in Baroque. The side portal faces Calzada Mexico-Tacuba. It also has an arched entryway, but marked with wavy grooved pilasters and topped with a niche. Part of the former cloister is also preserved. The interior is focused on the main altar, which is gilded and has twelve colonial era paintings of the Virgin Mary and various saints along with Salomonic columns. In the center is an image of the crucified Christ and the top has an image of God, the Father. One other feature of the church is an image of the Child Jesus called the “Niño futbolista” (Football playing child), named such because it is dressed in the uniform of Mexico’s national team when it plays in the World Cup . The Monastery of San Joaquín was fonded in 1689 by the Carmelites and conserves its original architecture. It was an important school for young priests. The Tacuba area is home to a neighborhood called Popotla. Here are the remains of a Montezuma cypress, under which it is said that Hernán Cortés sat and wept after being run out of Tenochtitlan during La Noche Triste in 1520. Next to the plaza where this tree is found, there is an old mansion whose east side has a mural called “Noche de la Victoria” (Night of the Victory) done in 2010. Also here is the parish called Pronto Socorro. Further east along the Calzada Tacuba-Mexico, there is the Colegio Militar, next to the Metro stop of the same name. This school was founded in 1823 and operated until 1976. Today it is the site of the Universidad del Ejército y Fuerza Aérea which still trains part of Mexico’s military. Tacuba is home to a Child Jesus image called the “Niño Futbolista” (Child Football/Soccer player). It is considered to be generous in granting miracles and is in a glass case surrounded by toys given by the faithful to favors received. Every four years, when the FIFA World Cup is played, this image is dressed in the uniform of the Mexico national football team, in the hopes that Mexico wins the cup."

It is believed that one of the local residents dreamt of the monument being under the earth. Moreover, she told the locals about the order of God to unearth the monument the very next day. This was found to be true and afterwards there occurred a flow of Hindus from all over the country to pay their homage to Lord Shiva. Now there is a beautiful temple sheltering the statue of Lord Shiva and is famous as Pancheswor Mahadev (पञ्चेश्वर महादेव) throughout the area and around the country."
