  "text" : "Strathcona was a city in Alberta, Canada, located on the south side of the North Saskatchewan River across from the City of Edmonton. Strathcona's recorded history began in the 1870s. Its first residents were an offshoot of the hangers-on and self-employed contractors who resided near the old Fort Edmonton on the north side of the river. This mixed community of British (especially Orkney), Québécois, Cree and Metis fur trade employees, pioneer farmers, hunters, and their families, was mostly replaced by eastern Canadian pioneer farmers (and land speculators) in the 1880s. The Calgary and Edmonton Railway arrived in 1891, establishing an urban hamlet centred on what is now Whyte Avenue. The townsite \"Plan I\" was registered September 25, 1891. Businesses, at first located in quickly-built primitive shacks, some made of logs, provided goods and services to a flood of immigrants from eastern Canada, Britain and continental Europe, U.S. and other parts of the world that came by train to the area. It was thought that \"South Edmonton\" would overwhelm \"Old Edmonton\" on the north side but Strathcona's geographic difficulties prevented this. However, Strathcona was in good enough position for businesses near the railway station to prosper. Over the following 20 years the centre's primitive buildings were replaced by more substantial two-storey wood or even brick buildings, many of which exist to this day. On May 29, 1899, Strathcona was incorporated as a town named after Lord Strathcona, Donald A. Smith. Smith was a prominent official in the Hudson's Bay Company and the Canadian Pacific Railway, that operated the Calgary and Edmonton Railway, the community's lifeline. The first mayor of Strathcona was Thomas Bennett. The original boundaries of the town included all the numbered river lots between #9 and #17 south of the river, corresponding to the area from present-day 109 Street in the west to 97 Street in the east and south to University Avenue, a total area of 1,000 acres (400 ha). In 1902, alarmed by fires that swept through many prairie communities at the time, Strathcona's town council passed an ordinance requiring that all buildings be constructed of fire-resistant materials, such as brick. This, along with the limited municipal re-development occurring south of the river after amalgamation, means that Whyte Avenue and the surrounding area has one of the largest stocks of vintage buildings in western Canada. After becoming a city on March 15, 1907, Premier A.C. Rutherford, Strathcona's MLA, established the University of Alberta in the City of Strathcona in 1908, with the purchase of the campus on the west edge of the city. Until the first campus buildings were completed, the University found a home in the Queen Alexandra Public School, still standing on 106 Street, then in the building that is now Old Scona Academic High School. In the 1911 census, Strathcona had a population of 5,579, while Edmonton had a population of 24,900. In anticipation of lower taxes and other benefits of being a larger city, an amalgamation of the two cities was proposed in which Strathcona and Edmonton residents voted 667-96 and 518-178 in favour of the merger respectively. The amalgamation of the two cities went into effect on February 1, 1912, resulting in increased policing and more affordable transit for Strathcona. At the time of the merger, Strathcona's boundaries were the North Saskatchewan River to the west and north, 91 Street to the east, and a combination of 62 Avenue and 68 Avenue to the south, with 111 Street comprising the brief jog between the two avenues. Whitemud Creek comprised the brief portion of the city's west boundary between 68 Avenue and the river. This included land annexed by Strathcona that was not fully developed until after WWII, well after the merger. Today's neighbourhood of Strathcona covers the portion of the former City of Strathcona lying east of 107 Street, north of Whyte Avenue, west of the Mill Creek ravine and south of the North Saskatchewan River valley. Also, the historic commercial core of the former City of Strathcona has been designated as the Old Strathcona Provincial Historic Area."

The journey along the Manali-Leh highway at high altitude and variable road conditions, normally takes two days, so travellers and tourists use this spot as an overnight stop. An Indian army camp is sited nearby on the banks of the Tsarap Chu river. The highway and thus the camp are closed during the winter, when snow blocks the high passes along the road. This spot can also be used as a start point for the difficult trek into the Zanskar region of Ladakh."

With the view of transferring population from densely populated regions of Bihar & Northern Provinces( Uttar Pradesh to waste lands/jungles of Burma, the British Government offered large tracts of land in Burma by way of Grants,to big Indian Zamindars & Princely States to take up the migration work. Invitations were sent to the Maharaja of Dumraon as well as to the Dewan of Dumraon State. While the Maharaja declined the offer, Dewan Jai Prakash Lall C.I.E. accepted the offer and was granted 18340 acres of land in Zayawadi region in Myanmar by the British Empire. Dewan Jai Prakash Lall C.I.E. & his son Rai Bahadur Harihar Prasad Singh took neighboring people from Bihar & Northern Provinces to Myanmar and let them cut and clean the forest in that land and allowed them to grow paddy & sugar cane to earn living. In 1934-35 a sugar mill, bought from Britain was set up by Rai Bahadur Harihar Prasad Singh & his son, Mr. Chandradeva Prakash Sinha. The mill had a capacity of 1000 tons per year initially, which was expanded to 2,500 tons before the second World War. The mill was the largest sugar mill in Burma of the time. New machinery was also bought during the war days to further expand capacity. The sugar factory had been running till 1952-53. In 1954 the mill was nationalized by the Myanmar Government and the factory was run by the Government thereafter."

Feeding Hills contains one quarter of the total population, as well as Provin Mountain, the highest point in the town, and many moderate-sized farms. Today, Feeding Hills is under extensive land development in and around the Provin Mountain communities. Several farms have been split up and sold to developers, resulting in an increased real estate market. Older sections of Feeding Hills, such as those closer to Line Street and Agawam High School, have remained much the same, although in recent years have experienced an exodus of businesses to other parts of town. Feeding Hills contains several churches, shopping centers, and a variety of eateries. It is home to WWLP-TV's transmitting site atop Provin Mountain (their studio has since moved to Chicopee). Agawam's police station can be found on Springfield St., one of the subsection's most populous roads. Of the 4 elementary schools and 3 md/jr/sr highs only the Junior High School and Granger Elementary, are located in \"Feeding Hills\""

Prior to receiving independent status, it served as the county seat of Chesterfield County, between 1870 and 1876. Today, it is a part of the city of Richmond, Virginia. Originally known as Manastoh and later Rocky Ridge, it was located on the south bank of the James River at the fall line opposite the state capital city of Richmond, on the north side of the river. Manchester was an active port city, and was a port of entry for slave ships principally in the 18th century. The port shipped out tobacco and coal which was transported 13 miles overland from the Midlothian-area mines on the Midlothian Turnpike, first paved toll road in Virginia in 1807, and the Chesterfield Railroad, the state's first in 1831. Manchester became an incorporated town in 1769 and an independent city in 1874. In 1910, it merged by mutual agreement with the larger state capital City of Richmond, achieving another \"first\" as the earliest of Virginia's independent cities to lose its identity. In modern times, \"Old Manchester\" is considered a neighborhood of Richmond. Many vestiges of its past are clearly visible, notably the courthouse, the Hull Street business district, a number of historic houses, and several former railroad and street railway buildings. As part of the community's African American heritage, a \"slave trail\" traces the route into the downtown area from where the slave ships are believed to have docked along the river. Interstate 95, and four other major highways, U.S. Routes 1, 60, 301 and 360 all cross the James River and enter downtown Richmond from Manchester."

  "text" : "Nguroje is a town found on the mambilla plateau,in Sardauna Local Government Area of Taraba State in eastern Nigeria.It is easy to see that the term \"Nguroje\" is an original rendering in Fulfulde (Fulani) language, derived from \"Ngu-ram\", meaning economic income. Thus, \"Ngu-ro-je\" (economic enclaves) is a plural of \"Ngu-ro-re\" (an economic enclave). The straight-away translation of the term \"Nguroje\" in English language is \"Living Springs\". \"Guroji\" is a non-Fulfulde rendering, perhaps by certain tribes that later came to settle in the town with the original Fulbe founders of the town.History of NgurojeOld Mbungnu (Mbungnu, Kwuo, Guroji, Nguroje) Old Mbungnu (Kwuo or Kwu-Mbungnu) was the cradle of the Mbunip and Magu clans of Mambilla down to about 1890 before they separated from here. Some “Kobira” came at the beginning of the British administration and settled on the abandoned Mbungnu site, obviously a little before the Hausa man, Musa Bichi, arrived at the camp. The kobiras were former abductees, majority of whom had escaped from their abductors after the Anglo-German War at Banyo of 1915. A few however came a few years before 1915. In the “Kobira” section, the Ward headship followed no specific line. The first Ward Head was one ‘Hamajulde’ who died in 1935. Then, ‘Dika Pullo’ became Ward Head in 1937 and died 1939. ‘Dika Pullo’ came from Tibati. Like most “Kobira”, neither his ancestry nor that of Hamajulde is ascertained. The next Ward Head was Barde, said by some to have been indigenous. He took over rulership in 1940. The Kobira, because of their “detention” or “incarceration” outside their homelands, usually lost their culture and became “elements of no culture”. They commonly betrayed their roots, in many instances pretending to be allies of their own erstwhile tormentors. Many of these Kobiras were simply those who mixed with Fulanis in their sojourning and tended to behave like Fulanis. This is not to show that all the existing inhabitants of Kwu-Mbungnu were by 1915 all Kobira. There were indeed remnants of the pre-existing Kwu-Mbungnu people who were erroneously classed with the Kobira.Hausa traders also pitched their tents at Kwu-Mbungnu on the ruins (“Guroji” = “ruins”) at the end German rule (c.1915) and inception of British suzerainty. The first itinerant Hausa traders then included he aforementioned Musa Bichi from Bichi of Kano, who was based in Garbabi and used to travel through Mambilla to Bamenda for trading just before the end of German rule. Under the British, he finally relocated from Garbabi to Old Mbungnu possibly in the late 1920s. He became the first Hausa to settle here at Old Mbungnu site. Musa Bichi of Kano thus became the first of the Hausa-settler trading colony that met the Kobira on the ruins of Kwu-Mbungnu. He was born and bred in Bichi near Kano and became the first Sarkin Hausawa (Ward Head) of the Hausa trading section of Kwu-Mbungnu, later called “Guroji”, Fulani term for ‘ruined town’ (a name used, until much later, exclusively by the newcomers at that time). Musa Bichi was the first head of only the Hausa section and was still Ward Head by 1932 (1938 I.R). By that year, there was no Fulani ward or head in the camp, the rare visiting graziers being noticed only in bush grass shacks.When the cattle selling point was first set up here by the British in about 1927, more and more Hausa traders and Fulani cattle sellers were attracted in the 1930s, more so by the opportunity provided by the opening in 1926 of the Government-organized Trade Route through Mambilla to Bamenda.In 2005, Kwu-Mbungnu (with the “Guroje” misnomer) was made one of 20 districts created by the 2005 Order. Historically, it had been the territorial jurisdiction of the Mbon Mbunibi (Chief of Mbunip) and the 1938 Intelligence Report suggested its subsequent return to the Chief of Mbunip."
