  "text" : "Kamunting (Malay pronunciation: /Kemunting/) is the biggest satellite town in Taiping's Larut, Matang dan Selama district, Perak, Malaysia. It is also the biggest industrial town in Taiping and is famous mainly for being home to the Kamunting Detention Center a prison camp for detainees under the Internal Security Act, many of whom are held without trial for an indefinite period. The prison has been nicknamed \"Malaysia's Gitmo\" (referring to the Guantanamo Bay or Gitmo prison for similar detainees in Cuba run by the United States), and holds about a hundred detainees as of 2006. During the Malayan Emergency between 1948 and 1960, Kamunting was the site of a major British/Commonwealth military base, there being a large garrison for the 28th Commonwealth Independent Infantry Brigade and also one of the three British Military Hospitals (BMHs) in Malaya. Between Taiping and Kamunting is one of the main Military Cemeteries in Malaya. Over the many years of the conflict against the Communist terrorists, thousands of British, Australian, New Zealand, Fijian and Gurkha troops lived - and died - in and around Kamunting and Taiping. Kamunting houses the main bus station (Kamunting Raya) for Taiping town. Soon the Taiping train station will relocate there too. It has a weekly night market every Saturday night near the bus station that sells all sorts of local fresh produce and food stuffs. There are also fruit sellers along the road leading to the Kamunting bus stops which sell seasonal fruits like durian and mangosteens. It also connects Taiping to the North-South Expressway via the northern exit. Major tourist spot is Bukit Jana, which has a waterfall and streams off the range of Bukit Larut. The Bukit Jana Golf & Country Club is also situated nearby. Plans for Taiping sports centre, which includes a 15000-seater stadium, indoor venues and extreme sports site, are still under consideration."
