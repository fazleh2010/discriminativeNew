Situated in Nevasa taluka in Ahmednagar district, the village is known for its popular temple of Shani, the Hindu god associated with the planet (graha) Saturn. Shingnapur is 35 km from Ahmednagar city. Shingnapur is also famous for the fact that no house in the village has doors, only door frames. Despite this, no theft was reported in the village until 2010 when cash and items worth Rs. 35000/- were stolen from a vehicle, then in 2011 when Rs. 50000/-, gold rings, mobile phone, etc. was stolen from the home of a retired official of the Shree Shanaishwar Devasthan Trust  and then again in January 2012 gold ornaments were stolen from within the temple. Still villagers never keep their valuables under lock and key. The temple is believed to be a \"jagrut devasthan\" (lit. \"alive temple\"), meaning that a deity still resides in the temple icon. Villagers believe that god Shani punishes anyone attempting theft. The deity here is \"Swayambhu\" (Sanskrit: self-evolved deity) that is self emerged from earth in form of black, imposing stone. Though no one knows the exact period, it is believed that the Swayambhu Shanaishwara statue was found by shepherds of the then local hamlet. It is believed to be in existence at least since the start of Kali yuga. The village has a post office and a high school known as Shri Shanishwar Vidya Mandir besides the primary schools run by the Zilla Parishad. The chief source of water supply in the village is wells. In January 2011, the United Commercial (UCO) Bank opened a 'lockless' branch in the village, the first of its kind in the country, taking note of the near-zero crime rate in the region. The local police were reported to be unhappy over this development and that it amounted to a breach of conditions, because the Central government of India has made it mandatory for all banks to have high security.The bank has doors,but they will always remain open. However, it was reported by the local legislator and the bank officials that adequate precautions were being taken for the safety of lockers and important documents."

  "text" : "Seutula (Swedish: Sjöskog) is a district in Vantaa, Finland, located inside the curve of the River Vantaa. Seutula is also a village in the medieval town of Helsinki, stretching to Rajakoski in the north, Lavanko in the east covering the whole district of Kiila, and including Sotilaskorpi in the south. On the other hand, the western part of the river's curve, including the Königstedt manor, belongs to the village of Riipilä. Seutula is often considered a region stretching even outside the official district, and it has an active local community. In terms of government, Seutula, Riipilä, and Kiila belong to the Kivistö major district. In the early 1950s, a new airfield for Helsinki was built along the Seutulantie road, stretching from Tuusulantie in Ruskeasanta to Seutula. This airfield was opened in 1952, and became the Helsinki Airport in 1977. Already during its construction, the airfield was commonly called the Seutula airfield, because Tuusulantie had a sign pointing to Seutula. In reality, the airfield was built about 8 kilometres southeast from Seutula, in the northern parts of Veromiehenkylä and Kirkonkylä. Nowadays, Lentokenttä (Finnish for \"airfield\") is its own district in Vantaa. The name Seutula is often connected to prisons, although there never has been a prison in Seutula. The reason for the connection is that the airfield was mainly built using prisoner labour. Some of the prisoners used to build the airfield were public figures of the 1960s, convicted of driving under influence, bringing the activity to light. An open prison was located in Seutula until 2009. This prison was originally called a labour colony, and one of its inmates in the 1960s was Irwin Goodman, who had made records about the subject called Terveisiä Seutulasta (\"greetings from Seutula\") and Autolla Kanarian saarille (\"to the Canary Islands by car\"), with lyrics by Vexi Salmi."

  "text" : "Jaisinghpur is a small town and Sub-Division in Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh, India. There is only one tehsil under Sub-Division Jaisinghpur, whish is situated at Jaisinghpur itself. Population of Jaisinghpur Town is 1,273 and overall population of Jaisinghpur Sub-Division is 58,623. It was named after the name of Katoch king of Princely ordered state Kangra-Lambagraon, Maharaja Jai Singh. It is situated on the bank of river Beas. It is known for its \"chaugan.\" There are several notable temples in the town such as Janaki Nath temple, Radhey Krishan temple near Bus Adda,Laxmi Narayan temple, Baba Mani Ram Temple, Neel Kanth Mahadev Temple, Dhudu Mahadev Mandir, Guga temple (Called Gangoti near Shitala Mata Mandir), Shitala Mata temple, a Dargah midtown, popularly known as Baba Shah Mast Ali Dargah and a Gurudwara on Jaisinghpur Lambagoan road. Shitala Mata temple is famous temple of the town on Tinbar-Palampur road. Another famous temple is Jankinath temple. There are many natural water resources in the town.'Baayein' near PWD Rest House and 'Naoun' is favorite place for all boys to have fun by swimming in summer, however it serves the major water need of people. Jaisinghpur is also famous for its vegetable production on the banks of Beas river the spot is popularly known as Bhuare ke Bagh. Once Jaisinghpur was also famous for vegetable growing on the banks of river Beas i.e. popularly known as bhuaray ka bagh. But nowadays the growing of crops including vegetables has been stopped in Jainsinghpur and entire adjoining area because of the increase of stray animals, monkeys, wild pigs, rabbits, deer’s (Kakkar, Barahsinga and neel gaye), which spoil crops completely. The menace of wild and stray animals has increased nowadays manifold probably because tigers/leopards which were responsible for keeping such animals under control have been killed by local poachers. Jaisinghpur has been also known as the first place in Kangra or perhaps in entire Himachal for staging Ramlila festival. Ramlila of Jaisinghpur started some 90 years ago and almost all the actors were Brahmin, mainly from Awasthi community. Pandit Balkishan Awasthi, a native of Jaisinghpur who lived in Mumbai for his work and also associated with theatre there, have brought all the Drama items required for Ramlila from Mumbai and started Ramlila festival single handedly at Jaisinghpur. He used to play the role of Ravana in the Ramlila and become very popular because of his dialogue delivery in strong deep voice and due to his tall, handsome personality. The uniqueness of the Ramlila was the Sanskrit language used at that time, most Ramlilas in North India are based on the 16th century Avadhi version of Ramayana, Ramcharitmanas, written by Gosvami Tulsidas entirely in verse, thus used as dialogues in most traditional versions. Jaisinghpur is also famous for its annual fair also known as holian which are celebrated in the month of march during the colour festival of holi. The Holian of Jaisinghpur are famous for its mouth watering aalu chholey and Jalebi and continues for almost a week. Holding of Kushti (wrestling) at Dargah during Holis is an annual affair watched by several visitors."

Some of the parks are dedicated to the usage of women (e.g. Mahila Park) and old age people. These parks do play a big role in making Yamuna Vihar a green and beautiful area.There is proper Police patrolling and monitoring in the area.Amongst its nearby areas, Yamuna Vihar is the only well-planned locality. Transportation from Yamua Vihar to Yamuna river crossing is messed up and need to be improved. One of the steps taken by the state government to improve transportation is the upcoming Signature Bridge, which is only at a distance of 4 km (2.5 mi). The upcoming Delhi Metro project will also improve this situation.It has many restaurants like the yellow chilli, Pizza Diet, Giani's, Basinghey etc. in and around it.
