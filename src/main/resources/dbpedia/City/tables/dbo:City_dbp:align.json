  "text" : "Petronia City is a 2000-acre master-planned city development project that aims to provide the first fully integrated business hub for West Africaâ€™s Oil, Gas and Mining industries.The proposed development is being undertaken by Wonda World Estate Development and the Petronia City Development affiliate. The said project is being hosted by Beahun and Yaabew communities in the Ahanta West District of the Western Region of Ghana, approximately 8kilometres from Takoradi. Petronia City is a self-sufficient and environmentally friendly city designed to address the infrastructure gap in the Western Region in the wake of the 2007 oil discovery and subsequent increase in social and economic activity in the region. Petronia City will cater to the needs of the oil and gas, mining, financial and government sectors and will provide a hub from which industry leading companies can expand into the sub-region and beyond. The project, conceived by Nana Kwame Bediako, the CEO of Wonda world estate and Petronia City Development Company Limited, kicked off in October 2013 and will unroll in phases over the next 10 years. Upon completion, the city will house approximately 30,000 residents and will include commercial, residential, civic, industrial, educational, and recreational facilities, providing a unique live, work, play and learn experience in West Africa."
