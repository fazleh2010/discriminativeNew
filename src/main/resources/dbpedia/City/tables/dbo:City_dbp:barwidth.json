It has the population of about 652,831 according to census 2011. It is believed to be the oldest inhabited place in the region. The main industry is the leather industry. It is home to some of the biggest leather tanneries in Northern India. The excavations conducted here by the Archaeological Survey of India suggest that it dates back to c. 1300 – 1200 BCE.
