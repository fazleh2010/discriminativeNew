  "text" : "(This article is about the village in Kerala, India. For the legendary discoverer of coffee, see Kaldi. For the Sri Lankan city, see Kalladi (Batticaloa).) Kalady or Kaladi is a census town located east of the Periyar river, in the Ernakulam district of Kerala, India near to Cochin International Airport at a distance of 6 Km . Notably, it is the birthplace of Adi Shankara and a popular destination for pilgrims. Kalady started featuring in the spiritual map of India only after its rediscovery in the late 19th century by the then Shankaracharya of Sringeri and the subsequent consecration of a temple for Sri Adi Shankara in 1910. The Centenary of Kalady was celebrated in May 2010 and the story of Kalady and its re-discovery a hundred years ago has been documented in a film by the Sringeri Sharada Peetham."
